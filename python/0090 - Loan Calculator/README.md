Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!

```python
> python creditcalc.py --type=diff --principal=1000000 --periods=10 --interest=10
Month 1: payment is 108334
Month 2: payment is 107500
Month 3: payment is 106667
Month 4: payment is 105834
Month 5: payment is 105000
Month 6: payment is 104167
Month 7: payment is 103334
Month 8: payment is 102500
Month 9: payment is 101667
Month 10: payment is 100834

Overpayment = 45837
```
