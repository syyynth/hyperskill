This is the *X-mas Tree* project I made myself.


<p>Welcome to a fun project that takes us back to the '80s and the world of ASCII characters. If you have ever been tasked with drawing a Christmas tree using asterisks in your programming journey, this project is for you. Drawing an entire Christmas card will make the task a bit more challenging. Get ready to have some fun!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/391?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/391</a>
