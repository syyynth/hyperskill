This project doesn't have any code (text based answers), it's just an indication of accomplishment.

This is the *Monty Hall Problem* project.

<p>Suppose you are a contestant in a game show where you can win a car prize if you correctly choose the door from among three doors. You choose door №1. The game host reveals the content of door №3 and it contains a goat. Then the host asked you whether you prefer to change the door. What would you do? Would you stick to your first choice or prefer to change it?
In this project, you will learn how to update your belief in the face of additional information using Bayesian statistics.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/280?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/280</a>
