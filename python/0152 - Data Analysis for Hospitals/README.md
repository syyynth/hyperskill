<p>You know the story. Data is everywhere: texts, images, news, and spreadsheets. It affects our habits and defines our future. The amount of data is growing by the second. How can one stay afloat in this great sea of data? Data analysis is required in any line of business. In this project, you will conduct a comprehensive study with pandas. You will upload datasets, deal with data omissions and incorrect data filling, find the main statistical characteristics, and visualize your data. Let's do it!</p>
