This is the *Dolly* project I made myself.

This git project doesn't really have any code, just a few git commands.

<p>In 1996 The Roslin Institute from Scotland cloned a sheep called Dolly. A big step in the history of humankind. You don't need to clone a sheep in this project, don't worry. Instead of Dolly, clone a remote repository. A clone is a copy of a repository, created in a new directory. The aim is usually to make a local copy of a remote repository that is hosted on a third-party service. After this, you can work on your local copy, make changes, and push the changes back.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/377?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/312</a>
