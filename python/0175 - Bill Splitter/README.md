Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

_Usage:_
```python
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 5
Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
> Marc
> Jem
> Monica
> Anna
> Jason
Enter the total bill value:
> 100
Do you want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature? Write Yes/No:
> Yes
Jem is the lucky one!
{'Marc': 25.0, 'Jem': 0, 'Monica': 25.0, 'Anna': 25.0, 'Jason': 25.0}

Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 3
Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
> Jake
> Sam
> Irina
Enter the total bill value:
> 109
Do you want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature? Write Yes/No:
> No
No one is going to be lucky
{'Jake': 36.33, 'Sam': 36.33, 'Irina': 36.33}
```
