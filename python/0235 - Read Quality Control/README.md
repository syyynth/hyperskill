Good afternoon, It's the HR department!



We've received your application for the bioinformatics researcher position. However, It is not clear from your CV whether you have the skills to assess the quality of raw sequencing data. We have a small test for you â€” select the best bacterial data archive and explain why. The archives are attached below. It would be excellent if your program could also indicate various data quality metrics. Good luck!



We are looking forward to hearing from you,



Your HR.
