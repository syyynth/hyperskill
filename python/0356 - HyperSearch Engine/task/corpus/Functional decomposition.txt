Functional decomposition is simply a process of decomposing a problem into several functions or methods. Each method does a particular task so that we can perform these methods in a row to get the results we need. When we look at a problem, we need to think about which actions we may want to repeat multiple times or, alternatively, perform separately. This is how we get the desired methods. As a result, these methods are easier to read, understand, reuse, test, and debug. 
Let's look at our Smart home app again and figure out which steps can be turned into separate methods. First of all, we can separate our main operations into three methods: one method to control the music, another one to turn the lights on and off, and the third to operate the door lock. Take a look at the method 
controlMusic() that controls the music.
