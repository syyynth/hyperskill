This interface specifies a contract that the method reads data (no matter from where) into the slice of bytes p and returns the n number of bytes read. This number cannot exceed the size of the slice (len(p)). Slice size must be set in advance. If something goes wrong, the method should return an error. If the data is all read, the method also returns an error, but a special one. This is io.EOF (end of file). You must take this into account in your code in order to correctly complete the read operation.
