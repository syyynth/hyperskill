Functions can make life easier, provided one is aware of their existence. Many algorithms are already written, so there is no need for reinvention, except perhaps for educational purposes. The Python interpreter has several functions and types built into it, so they are always available. Currently, the number of built-in functions amounts to 69 (in the Python 3.8 version). Some of them are used to convert the object type, for example, str() returns a string, int() returns an integer, and float() returns a floating-point number. Others deal with numbers: you can round() them and sum() them, find the minimum min() or the maximum max(). Still, others give us information about the object: its type() or length len().
