**This project doesn't have any code that could be shared, but it's a part of one of the Python's paths**


This is the *Tagger* project I made myself.


<p>Git tagging allows you to mark what's essential in your project's history. These tags act like permanent markers, making it easier to reference important versions or milestones of your code. Tags are typically used to mark releases or significant points in your project's development. Unlike branches, tags do not change or move when you make new changes, which means you can always find and use them whenever you need to. Your task for this project is to create tags to mark important moments.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/377?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/377</a>
