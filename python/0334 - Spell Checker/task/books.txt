PREFACE\
\
\
The aim of this book is to give the materials for the inductive study of\
English verse. Its origin was in certain university courses, for which\
it proved to be necessary--often for use in a single hour's work--to\
gather almost numberless books, some of which must ordinarily be\
inaccessible except in the vicinity of large libraries. I have tried to\
extract from these books the materials necessary for the study of\
English verse-forms, adding notes designed to make the specimens\
intelligible and useful.\
\
Dealing with a subject where theories are almost as numerous as those\
who have written on it, it has been my purpose to avoid the setting\
forth of my own opinions, and to present the subject-matter in a way\
suited, so far as possible, to the use of those holding widely divergent\
views. In the arrangement and naming of the earlier sections of the\
book, some systematic theory of the subject--accepted at least\
tentatively--was indeed indispensable; but I trust that even here those\
who would apply to English verse a different classification or\
terminology may be able to discard what they cannot approve and to make\
use of the specimens from their own standpoint. Even where (as in these\
introductory sections) the notes seem to overtop the text somewhat\
threateningly, they are invariably intended--as the type indicates--to\
be subordinate. Where it has been possible to do so, I have preferred to\
present comments on the specimens in the words of other writers, and\
have not confined these notes to opinions with which I wholly agree, but\
only to those which seem worthy of attention. My own views on the more\
disputed elements of the subject (such as the relations of time and\
accent in our verse, the presence of "quantity" in English, and the\
terminology of the subject) I have reserved for Part Three, where I\
trust they will be found helpful by some readers, but where they may\
easily be passed over.\
\
To classify the materials of this subject is peculiarly difficult, and\
one who tries to solve the problem will early abandon the hope of being\
able to follow any system with consistency. Main divisions and\
subdivisions will inevitably conflict and overlap. For practical\
purposes, basing my arrangement in part on that found convenient in\
university lectures (which it will be seen is not altogether unlike that\
followed by Schipper in his _Englische Metrik_), I have divided the\
specimens of verse into two main divisions, each of which is suggested\
by a word in the sub-title of the book. Part One contains specimens\
designed to illustrate the principles of English verse, arranged in\
topical order. Part Two contains specimens designed to illustrate the\
history of the more important forms of English verse, arranged--in the\
several divisions--in chronological order. Part Three has already been\
spoken of. Part Four contains extracts from important critical writers\
on the place and function of the verse-element in poetry,--matters which\
give us the _raison d'\'eatre_ for the whole study of versification.\
\
If there had ever been hope of making the collection of specimens fairly\
complete, even in a representative sense, this would have been\
dissipated by the discovery, during the very time of the book's going\
through the press, of a number of additional specimens which it seemed\
wicked to omit. Doubtless every reader will miss some favorite selection\
which might well have been included, and suggestions as to important\
omissions will be received gratefully. The attempt has been to put\
students on the track of all the more important lines of development of\
English verse, and to indicate, by including a considerable number of\
specimens from early periods, the continuity of this development from\
the times of our Saxon forefathers to our own.\
\
Little consistency can be claimed for the practice observed in the\
matter of modernizing texts that date from transition periods like the\
sixteenth century. In some cases the text has been modernized, or\
retained in its original form, according as it seemed well to emphasize\
either the permanent significance or the historical position of the\
specimen in question. In other cases the form of the text was determined\
merely by the best edition accessible for purposes of reproduction.\
\
Dates have been appended to the specimens in those sections where\
chronology is a significant element. It has not always been possible to\
verify these dates with thoroughness, or to distinguish between the date\
of writing and that of publication; but it is hoped that inaccuracies of\
this sort will at least not be found of a character to misrepresent the\
historical relations of the specimens. Dates are not ordinarily given\
for the poems of writers still living.\
\
In the notes on the specimens I have tried to distinguish between\
material likely to be useful for all students of the subject and that\
going more into detail, which is intended only for advanced or special\
students. Notes of the second class are printed in smaller type. There\
has been no attempt to give the notes of a bibliographical character any\
pretension to completeness. One may well hesitate to add, in this\
direction, to the admirable material presented in the _Methods and\
Materials of Literary Criticism_ of Professors Gayley and Scott.\
\
I have resisted strenuously all temptation to choose or to annotate\
specimens on general grounds of \'e6sthetic enjoyment, apart from the\
distinct study of verse-forms. Yet it would be useless to deny having\
sometimes made choice of particular verses, all other considerations\
being equal, for their poetic or literary value over and above their\
prosodical. I shall not claim for the collection what Boswell did for\
Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, that "he was so attentive in the choice" of\
the illustrative passages "that one may read page after page ... with\
improvement and pleasure;" yet I may say that, so far from fearing that\
the enjoyment of any poem will be injured by a proper attention to the\
elements of its metrical form, it is my hope that many a haunting verse\
may linger, a perpetual possession of beauty, in the memory of the\
student who first found it here classified under a technical name.\
\
Many obligations are to be acknowledged to scholars of whose advice I\
have availed myself. Most kindly aid has been received from Professor G.\
L. Kittredge and Dr. Fred N. Robinson, of Harvard University; from\
Professor Felix E. Schelling, of the University of Pennsylvania; from my\
friend, Mr. H. P. Earle, of Stanford University; and from my colleague,\
Dr. Ewald Fl\'fcgel. My obligation to Schipper's monumental works on\
English verse will be obvious to every scholar. They suggested many of\
the specimens of verse-forms, and are also represented by translations\
or paraphrases in the notes; references to Schipper, without full\
title, are to the _Englische Metrik_,--the larger work. I have also made\
thankful use of Mr. John Addington Symonds's essays on Blank Verse, and\
of Professor Corson's _Primer of English Verse_,--both somewhat\
unscientific but highly suggestive works. The section on Artificial\
French Forms obviously owes very much to Mr. Gleeson White's _Ballades\
and Rondeaus_. A book to which my obligation is out of all proportion to\
the number of actual quotations from it is Mr. J. B. Mayor's _Chapters\
on English Metre_. This modest but satisfying volume seemed to me, when\
I first was taking up the study of English verse, to be a grateful\
relief from the thorny and often fruitless discussions with which the\
subject had been overgrown; and in returning to it again and again, I\
have never failed to renew the impression. Its suggestions underlie a\
good part of the system of classification and terminology adopted for\
this book. The new and enlarged edition came to hand too late for use,\
but I was able to include references to it in the notes.\
\
I must also record thanks to those authors and publishers who have\
courteously given permission for the reproduction of their publications:\
to Mr. John Lane, for permission to quote from the works of Mr. William\
Watson and Mr. Stephen Phillips; to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and\
Company, for permission to make extracts from the poems of Mr. William\
Vaughn Moody and from Mr. Stedman's _Nature and Elements of Poetry_; to\
Macmillan and Company, Limited, of London, for permission to make\
extracts from Professor Butcher's _Aristotle's Theory of Poetry_ and\
from Mr. Courthope's _Life in Poetry and Law in Taste_; to Professor F.\
B. Gummere and The Macmillan Company of New York, for permission to\
quote from the former's _Beginnings of Poetry_; to the Lothrop\
Publishing Company of Boston, for permission to reprint Mr. Clinton\
Scollard's villanelle, "Spring Knocks at Winter's Frosty Door," from the\
volume entitled _With Reed and Lyre_; to Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman,\
for permission to reprint her rondeau, "A Man must Live," from the\
volume entitled _On This Our World_ (published by Small, Maynard and\
Company); to Dr. Samuel Minturn Peck, for permission to reprint one of\
the triolets called "Under the Rose," from his volume entitled _Cap and\
Bells_; to the Frederick A. Stokes Company, for permission to reprint\
Mr. Frank D. Sherman's "Ballade to Austin Dobson," from the volume\
entitled _Madrigals and Catches_. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Mr. W. E.\
Henley, and Mr. Edmund Gosse have given generous permission to quote\
freely from their poems. Mr. Henley was also good enough to suggest the\
choice of the rondeau from his "Bric-\'e0-Brac"; and Mr. Gosse, whose\
unfailing courtesy follows up his numerous published aids to students of\
English poetry, has also added some personal notes on the history of the\
heroic couplet.\
\
Finally, it should be said that a considerable part of the studies\
resulting in this book was carried on while the editor held the Senior\
Fellowship in English on the Harrison Foundation in the University of\
Pennsylvania. If, therefore, the book should prove of service to any,\
the fact will be a single additional tribute to the munificence of that\
foundation.\

\
\
I. ACCENT AND TIME\
\
\
A.--KINDS OF ACCENT\
\
The accents of English syllables as appearing in verse are commonly\
classified in two ways: according to degree of intensity, and according\
to cause or significance.\
\
Obviously there can be no fixed limits to the number of degrees of\
intensity recognized in syllabic accent or stress. It is common to speak\
of three such degrees: syllables having accent (stressed), syllables\
having secondary accent, and syllables without accent (unstressed).\
Schipper makes four groups: Principal Accent (_Hauptaccent_ or\
_Hochton_), Secondary Accent (_Nebenaccent_ or _Tiefton_), No Accent\
(_Tonlosigkeit_), and Disappearance of Sound (_Stummheit_). In\
illustration he gives the word _ponderous_, where the first syllable has\
the chief accent, the last a secondary accent, the second no accent;\
while in the verse\
\
    "Most ponderous and substantial things"\
\
the second syllable is suppressed or silent.\
\
Mr. A. J. Ellis, in like manner, recognized three principal classes of\
syllables: those stressed in the first degree, those stressed in the\
second degree, and those unstressed.[1] In the following lines from\
_Paradise Lost_ he indicated these three degrees, as he recognized them,\
by the figures 2, 1, 0, written underneath.\
\
      Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit\
       0   2      1   0 0 2    0     0   0   2\
\
      Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste\
       0   1    0 2   0   1      0    2  0   2\
\
      Brought death into the world, and all our woe,\
         1      2    0 0  0    2     0    1  0   2\
\
      With loss of Eden, till one greater man\
        0    1   0 2  0    0   0    2   0  2\
\
      Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,\
        0  2   0   0   0  2   0    2   0   2\
\
      Sing, heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top\
        2     2    0  2      1    0  0   2  0   1\
\
      Of Horeb or of Sinai, didst inspire\
       0  2  0  0  0  2  0    1    0  2\

        1    2   0    0    2     2     0   2  0   2\
\
      In the beginning, how the heavens and earth\
       0  0   0  2   0   1   0    2      0   2\
\
      Rose out of chaos.[2]\
       2    0   0  2  0\
\
It is worthy of note that the secondary accent seems originally to have\
been a more important factor in English verse than it is commonly\
considered to be in modern periods. In Anglo-Saxon verse the combination\
of a primary stress, a secondary stress, and an unstressed syllable, is\
a recognized type. In modern verse the reader is likely to make an\
effort to reduce all syllables to the type of either stress or\
no-stress. In such a verse as the following, however (from Matthew\
Arnold's _Forsaken Merman_),--\
\
    "And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee,"--\
\
we may find such a combination as that just referred to as familiar in\
Anglo-Saxon rhythm. The syllables "_soul, Merman_" are respectively\
cases of primary stress, secondary stress, and no-stress. On this matter\
see further the remark of Luick, cited on p. 156, below.\
\
     The element of Pitch is not ordinarily included in the treatment of\
     versification, as it is not ordinarily recognized as having any\
     significance peculiar to verse. According to Professor J. W.\
     Bright, however, there is such a thing as a "pitch-accent" which\
     plays an important part in verse where the word-accent conflicts\
     with that of the regular metre. Under certain exigencies, he says,\
     "_un-governed, pre-cisely, re-markable,_ and _Je-rusalem_ ... are\
     naturally pronounced with a pitch-accent upon the first syllables,\
     and with the undisturbed expiratory word-accent upon the second. It\
     will of course be understood that when the word-accent is defined\
     as expiratory this term does not exclude the inherent pitch of\
     English stress. Force, quantity, and pitch are combined in our\
     word-stress (or word-accent), both primary and secondary; but in\
     the secondary stress used as ictus there is a noticeable change in\
     the proportions of these elements, the pitch being relatively\
     increased. An answer is thus won for the question: How do we\
     naturally pronounce two stresses in juxtaposition on the same word,\
     or on adjacent words closely joined grammatically? This is further\
     illustrated in the specially emphasized words of such expressions\
     as 'The idea!'" where Professor Bright marks the pitch-accent on\
     the first syllable of "idea," retaining the stress-accent on the\
     second syllable. In the line\
\
        "Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit"\
\
     he marks a pitch-accent where the word-stress and metrical stress\
     are in conflict, that is, on the syllables "dis-" and "and." "The\
     rhythmic use of 'disobedience,'" he says, "illustrates with its\
     four syllables (as here used) as many recognizable varieties of\
     stress. The first syllable has a secondary word-accent, raised to a\
     pitch-accent for ictus; the second is wholly unaccented; the third\
     has the chief word-accent, employed as ictus (the accent of the\
     preceding word, "first," is subordinate to the rhythm); the fourth\
     has a secondary word-accent which remains unchanged in the thesis."\
     The conclusion is that "ictus in conflict requires a pitch-accent."\
     (All these quotations are from an article on 'Proper Names in Old\
     English Verse,' in the _Publications of the Modern Language\
     Association_, n.s. vol. vii. No. 3). Professor Bright's theory of\
     pitch-accent is a part of his general theory of opposition to what\
     he calls the "sense-doctrine" of the reading of verse,--that is,\
     the accepted doctrine that the word and sentence accents must\
     ordinarily take precedence of the metrical accent.\
\
According to cause or significance, accents are commonly classed in\
three groups: Etymological or Word Accent, Syntactical or Rhetorical\
Accent, and Metrical Accent. Accents of the first class are due to the\
original stress of the syllable in English speech; those of the second\
class are due to the importance of the syllable in the sentence; those\
of the third class are due to the place of the syllable in the metrical\
scheme. In the verse\
\
    "Mary had a little lamb,"\
\
the first syllable may be said to be stressed primarily for etymological\
reasons, the seventh primarily for syntactical or rhetorical reasons,\
and the third (which would not be accented in prose) for metrical\
reasons.\
\
The general law of English verse is that only those syllables which bear\
the accent of the first class (that is, which are stressed in common\
speech), together with monosyllables which on occasion are stressed in\
common speech, shall be placed so as to receive the metrical stress; and\
that, if the word-stress and the metrical stress apparently conflict,\
the metrical stress must yield. Less generally, the rhetorical or\
syntactical accent in the same way takes precedence of the metrical. In\
both cases exceptions are of course numerous.\
\
The following are examples of verses showing a conflict between the\
normal prose-accent and the normal verse-accent, where--as commonly\
read--the prose- (word-) accent triumphs.\
\
    The blessed damozel leaned out\
    _From the gold bar_ of heaven.\
\
(ROSSETTI: _The Blessed Damozel._)\
\
    _Love is_ a smoke _raised with_ the fume of sighs;\
    Being purged, a fire _sparkling_ in lover's eyes;\
    Being vexed, a sea _nourished_ with lover's tears.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Romeo and Juliet_, I. i. 196 ff.)\
\
    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\
    And fear'st to die? _famine_ is in thy cheeks,\
    _Need and_ oppression starveth in thine eyes.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _ib._ V. i. 68 ff.)\
\
    _Till, at_ his second bidding, Darkness fled,\
    _Light_ shone, and order from disorder sprung.\
    _Swift to_ their several quarters hasted then\
    The cumbrous elements--_Earth_, Flood, _Air_, Fire;\
    And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven\
    Flew upward, _spirited_ with various forms,\
    That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars\
    _Numberless_, as thou seest, and how they move.\
\
(MILTON: _Paradise Lost_, iii. 712 ff.)\
\
    _She was_ a gordian shape of dazzling hue,\
    Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;\
    _Striped like_ a zebra, freckled like a pard,\
    _Eyed like_ a peacock, and all crimson barred.\
\
(KEATS: _Lamia_, i. 47 ff.)\
\
    _"Boys!"_ shriek'd the old king, but vainlier than a hen\
    _To her_ false daughters in the pool; for none\
    Regarded; neither seem'd there more to say.\
    _Back_ rode we to my father's camp, and found\
    He thrice had sent a herald to the gates.\
\
(TENNYSON: _The Princess_, v. 318 ff.)\
\
    Sequestered nest!--this kingdom, limited\
    Alone by one old _populous green_ wall;\
    _Tenanted_ by the ever-busy flies,\
    _Gray crickets and shy lizards and quick spiders_;\
    Each family of the silver-threaded moss--\
    Which, look through near, this way, and it appears\
    A stubble-field _or a cane-brake_, a marsh\
    Of bulrush whitening _in the_ sun: _laugh now_!\
\
(BROWNING: _Paracelsus_, i. 36 ff.)\
\
On the other hand, we find verses showing a conflict between prose and\
verse accent, where the verse-accent may be regarded as triumphing\
wholly or in part. Where this triumph is complete, the accent is said to\
be _wrenched_; as, for example, in old ballad endings like "north\
countree."[3] Where there is a compromise effected in reading, the\
accent is said to be _hovering_; as in one of Shakspere's songs,--\
\
    "It was a lover and his lass ...\
    That o'er the green _corn-field_ did pass."\
\
    I sat with Love upon a woodside well,\
    Leaning across the water, I and he;\
    Nor ever did he speak nor looked at me,\
    But touched his lute wherein was _audible_\
    The certain secret thing he had to tell:\
    Only our mirrored eyes met _silently_\
    In the low wave; and that sound came to be\
    The passionate voice I knew; and my tears fell.\
    And at their fall, his eyes beneath grew hers;\
    And with his foot and with his _wing-feathers_\
    He swept the spring that watered my heart's drouth.\
    Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair,\
    And as I stooped, her own lips rising there\
    Bubbled with brimming kisses at my mouth.\
\
(ROSSETTI: _Willowwood. House of Life_, Sonnet xlix.)\
\
    I wish my grave were growing green,\
    A winding-sheet drawn ower my een,\
    And I in Helen's arms _lying,_\
        On fair Kirconnell lea.\
\
(_Fair Helen_; old ballad.)\
\
    For the stars and the winds are unto her\
    As raiment, as songs of the _harp-player._\
\
(SWINBURNE: Chorus in _Atalanta in Calydon._)\
\
    Nothing is better, I well think,\
      Than love; the hidden _well-water_\
    Is not so delicate to drink:\
      This was well seen of me and her.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _The Leper._)\
\
These wrenched accents are characteristic of one phase of the so-called\
"pre-Raphaelite" poetry of the Victorian period; in part, no doubt, they\
are due to the influence of the old ballads. My colleague Professor\
Newcomer has suggested that they are partly due, also, to a dislike for\
the combative accent which would occur where two heavy syllables came\
together (accented as commonly) in a compound like "harp-player."\
\
     Of special interest are the examples of wrenched and hovering\
     accent found in the verse of Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of\
     Surrey,--more especially in Wyatt. These mark the time when the\
     syllable-counting principle was coming into prominence in English\
     verse, under the new culture of the days of Henry VIII. The first\
     conscious followers of this principle seem to have given it such\
     prominence that a verse seemed good to them if it contained the\
     requisite number of syllables, whether the accents conformed to any\
     regular system or not. In the case of Wyatt we can also compare the\
     original forms of many of his poems, as preserved in manuscript,\
     with the revised forms as printed in Tottel's Miscellany (1557).\
     (See Dr. Fl\'fcgel's transcriptions from the Wyatt Mss., in _Anglia_,\
     vol. xviii.) The following is the octave of one of the sonnets, as\
     found in the Ms.:\
\
        "Avysing the bright bemes of these fayer Iyes\
        where he is that myn oft moisteth and wassheth\
        the werid mynde streght from the hert departeth\
        for to rest in his woroldly paradise\
        And fynde the swete bitter under this gyse\
        what webbes he hath wrought well he parceveth\
        whereby with himselfe on love he playneth\
        that spurreth with fyer: and bridillith with Ise."\
\
     (_Anglia,_ xviii. 465.)\
\
     Compare this with the revised form in Tottel's edition:\
\
        "Avisyng the bright beames of those fayre eyes,\
        Where he abides that mine oft moistes and washeth:\
        The weried mynd streight from the hart departeth,\
        To rest within hys worldly Paradise,\
        And bitter findes the swete, under this gyse.\
        What webbes there he hath wrought, well he preceaveth\
        Whereby then with him self on love he playneth,\
        That spurs wyth fire, and brydleth eke with yse."\
\
     (Arber Reprint, p. 40.)\
\
     It appears that this revision was the work of the editor, who had a\
     better sense of true English rhythm than the poet himself. Alscher,\
     however, in his work on Wyatt, contends that Wyatt doubtless\
     revised his own verses so as to give them their finished form. (See\
     _Sir Thomas Wyatt und Seine Stellung_, etc., p. 49.) Other lines in\
     Wyatt's verse where the number of syllables is counted but where\
     the accents are faulty, are these:\
\
        "The long love that in my thought I harbour."\
\
        "And there campeth displaying his banner."\
\
        "And there him hideth and not appeareth."\
\
        "For good is the life, ending faithfully."\
\
     Another large group of hovering accents is that formed by French\
     words with such terminations as _-our_, _-ance_, _-ace_, _-age_,\
     _-ant_, _-ess_. In such cases the original tendency of the word was\
     to accent the final syllable; but the general tendency of English\
     accents being recessive, the words often passed through a\
     transitional period when the accent was variable or "hovering." The\
     first of the four lines just quoted shows us a word of this\
     character.\
\
     For an interesting presentation of certain phases of the laws of\
     stress in English verse, see Robert Bridges's _Milton's Prosody_\
     (ed. 1901), Appendix J, "on the Rules of Stress Rhythms."\
\
\
B.--TIME-INTERVALS\
\
The fundamental principle of the rhythm of English verse (and indeed of\
any rhythm) is that _the accents appear at regular time-intervals_. In\
practice there is of course great freedom in departing from this\
regularity, the equal time-intervals being at times only a standard of\
rhythm to which the varying successions of accented and unaccented\
syllables are mentally referred. Where the equal time-intervals are\
observed with substantial regularity, two sorts of verse are still to\
be clearly distinguished: that in which not only the intervals of time\
but the numbers of syllables between the accents are substantially equal\
and regular, and that in which the number of syllables varies. The\
latter class is that of the native Germanic metres; the former is that\
of the Romance metres, and of modern English verse as influenced by\
them. With the development of regularity in the counting of syllables\
there has perhaps also taken place a development of regularity in the\
regular counting of the time-intervals. In other words, the modern\
English reader, where the number of syllables between accents is\
variable, makes the time-intervals as nearly equal as possible by\
lengthening and shortening the syllables in the manner permitted by the\
freedom of English speech; in early English verse, where the number of\
syllables between accents varied very greatly, we cannot be sure that\
the time-intervals were so accurately felt or preserved in recitation.\
\
\
i. _Verse showing fairly regular intervals between accents_\
\
    Avoid extremes; and shun the fault of such\
    Who still are pleas'd too little or too much.\
    At every trifle scorn to take offence,\
    That always shows great pride, or little sense:\
    Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,\
    Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.\
    Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move;\
    For fools admire, but men of sense approve:\
    As things seem large which we through mist descry,\
    Dulness is ever apt to magnify.\

\
(COLERIDGE: _Christabel_, Part I. 1816.)\
\
In his Preface to this poem Coleridge said: "The metre of the\
_Christabel_ is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so\
from its being founded on a new principle; namely, that of counting in\
each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may vary\
from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be\
only four. Nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables\
is not introduced wantonly, or for the mere ends of convenience, but in\
correspondence with some transition, in the nature of the imagery or\
passion." The verse is accurately described, but it has frequently been\
pointed out as curious that Coleridge should have spoken of it as\
"founded on a new principle," when the principle in question was that of\
native English verse from the earliest times.[5]\
\
For other specimens of verse showing irregularity in the number of\
syllables between the accents, see Part Two, under Non-syllable-counting\
Four-stress Verse.\
\
\
iii. _Silent Time-intervals between Syllables (Pauses)_\
\
(a) Pauses not filling the time of syllables.\
\
Most English verses of more than eight syllables are divided not only\
into the time-intervals between the accents, but also into two parts\
(which Schipper calls "rhythmical series") by the _Cesura_. The Cesura\
is a pause not counted out of the regular time of the rhythm, but\
corresponding to the pauses between "phrases" in music, and nearly\
always coinciding with syntactical or rhetorical divisions of the\
sentence.\
\
The medial cesura is the typical pause of this kind, dividing the verse\
into two parts of approximately equal length. In much early English\
verse, and in French verse, this medial cesura is almost universal; in\
modern English verse (and in that of some early poets, notably Chaucer)\
there is great freedom in the placing of the cesura, and also in\
omitting it altogether. The importance of this matter in the history of\
English decasyllabic verse will appear in Part Two.\
\
     In the early Elizabethan period the impression was still general\
     that there should be a regular medial cesura. Spenser seems to have\
     been the first to imitate the greater freedom of Chaucer in this\
     regard. See the Latin dissertation on Spenser's verse of E. Legouis\
     (_Quomodo E. Spenserus_, etc., Paris, 1896), and the summary of its\
     results by Mr. J. B. Fletcher in _Modern Language Notes_ for\
     November, 1898. "Spenser," says Mr. Fletcher, "revived for 'heroic\
     verse' the neglected variety in unity of his self-acknowledged\
     master, Chaucer." In Gascoigne's _Notes of Instruction concerning\
     the making of verse or ryme in English_ (1575), we find: "There are\
     also certayne pauses or restes in a verse whiche may be called\
     Ceasures.... In mine opinion in a verse of eight sillables, the\
     pause will stand best in the middest, in a verse of tenne it will\
     be placed at the ende of the first foure sillables; in a verse of\
     twelve, in the midst.... In Rithme royall, it is at the wryters\
     discretion, and forceth not where the pause be untill the ende of\
     the line." This greater liberty allowed the rime royal is doubtless\
     due to the influence of Chaucer on that form. For Gascoigne's\
     practice in printing his verse with medial cesura, even without\
     regard to rhetorical divisions, see the specimen given below.\
\
     Another interesting Elizabethan account of the cesura is found in\
     Puttenham's _Arte of English Poesie_ (1589), where the writer\
     compares the verse-pause to a stop made by a traveler at an inn for\
     rest and refreshment. (Arber's Reprint, p. 88.)\
\
_Specimen of French alexandrine, showing the regular medial cesura:_\
\
    Trois fois cinquante jours le g\'e9n\'e9ral naufrage\
    D\'e9gasta l'univers; en fin d'un tel ravage\
    L'immortel s'\'e9mouvant, n'e\'fbt pas sonn\'e9 si t\'f4t\
    La retraite des eaux que soudain flot sur flot\
    Elles gaignent au pied; tous les fleuves s'abaissant.\
    Le mer rentre en prison; les montagnes renaissent.\
\

\
See further, on the character of the French alexandrine and its medial\
cesura, in Part Two, under Six-stress Verse.\
\
_Specimen of early blank verse printed with regular medial cesura:_\
\
    O Knights, O Squires, O Gentle blouds yborne,\
    You were not borne, al onely for your selves:\
    Your countrie claymes, some part of al your paines.\
    There should you live, and therein should you toyle,\
    To hold up right, and banish cruel wrong,\
    To helpe the pore, to bridle backe the riche,\
    To punish vice, and vertue to advaunce,\
    To see God servde, and Belzebub supprest.\
    You should not trust, lieftenaunts in your rome,\
    And let them sway, the scepter of your charge,\
    Whiles you (meane while) know scarcely what is don,\
    Nor yet can yeld, accompt if you were callde.\
\
(GASCOIGNE: _The Steel Glass_, ll. 439 ff. 1576.)\
\
For specimens of regular medial cesura, and of variable cesura, in\
modern verse, see under the Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse, in\
Part Two.\
\
The Cesura is called _masculine_ when it follows an accented syllable.\
(For examples, see previous specimen from Gascoigne.) It is called\
_feminine_ when it follows an unaccented syllable. Two varieties of the\
feminine cesura are also distinguished: the Lyric, when the pause occurs\
inside a foot; _e.g._:\
\
    "This wicked traitor, whom I thus accuse;"\
\
the Epic, when the pause occurs after an extra (hypermetrical) light\
syllable; _e.g._:\
\
    "To Canterbury with ful devout corage."\
\
    "But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives."\
\
The "epic" cesura is quite as characteristic of dramatic blank verse as\
of epic.\
\
The pause occurring at the end of a line is equally regular with the\
medial pause, and corresponds in the same way to a phrase-pause in\
music. It is an element of the same character, then, as the cesura,\
though not bearing the same name. It coincides less closely than the\
cesura with syntactical and rhetorical pauses. When there is no\
corresponding syntactical or rhetorical pause at the end of the line (in\
other words, when the metrical pause marking the end of the verse cannot\
be prominently represented in reading without interfering with the\
expression of the sense), the line is said to be "run-on." Such an\
ending is also called _enjambement_. The importance of this distinction\
between "end-stopped" and "run-on" lines will appear in the notes on the\
Decasyllabic Couplet and Blank Verse, in Part Two.\
\
(_b_) Pauses filling the time of syllables.\
\
A second class of silent time-intervals, or pauses, is to be\
distinguished from the cesural pause by the fact that in this case the\
time of the pause is counted in the metrical scheme. Pauses of this\
class correspond to rests in music; and as in the case of such rests,\
their occurrence is exceptional.\
\
    Of fustian he wered a gipoun\
    \uc0\u8248  Al bismotered with his habergeoun.\
\
    For him was lever have at his beddes heed\
    \uc0\u8248  Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed.\
\
(CHAUCER: Prologue to _Canterbury Tales_, 75 f. and 293 f.)\
\
This omission of the first light syllable is characteristic of Chaucer's\
couplet and of Middle English verse generally. (See Schipper, vol. i. p.\
462, and ten Brink's _Chaucer's Sprache und Verskunst_, p. 175.) In\
modern verse it is not usually permitted.\
\
    The time doth pass, \uc0\u8248  yet shall not my love.\
\
(WYATT: _The joy so short, alas!_)\
\
The omitted syllable following the medial pause is closely parallel to\
that at the beginning of the verse.\
\
    Stay! \uc0\u8248  The king hath thrown his warder down.\
\
(_Richard II_, I. iii. 118.)\
\
    Kneel thou down, Philip. \uc0\u8248  But rise more great.\
\
(_King John_, I. i. 161.)\
\
    In drops of sorrow. \uc0\u8248  Sons, kinsmen, thanes.\
\
(_Macbeth_, I. iv. 35.)\
\
    Than the soft myrtle. \uc0\u8248  But man, proud man.\
\
(_Measure for Measure_, II. ii. 117.)\
\
These specimens of pauses in Shakspere's verse indicate the natural\
varieties of dramatic form. In such cases the pause often occurs\
between speeches, or where some action is to be understood as filling\
the time; as in the second instance, where the accolade is given in the\
middle of the line. (See Abbott's _Shakespearian Grammar_, pp. 413 ff.)\
\
    \uc0\u8248  Break, \u8248  break, \u8248  break,\
      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!\
    And I would that my tongue could utter\
      The thoughts that arise in me.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Break, Break, Break._)\
\
In Lanier's _Science of English Verse_, p. 101, this stanza is\
represented in musical notation, with rests, to show that rhythm "may be\
dependent on silences."\
\
    Should auld acquaintance be forgot,\
      And never brought to mind?\
    Should auld acquaintance be forgot,\
      And auld \uc0\u8248  lang \u8248  syne?\
\
(BURNS: _Auld Lang Syne._)\
\
Here the syllables "auld" and "lang" may be regarded as lengthened so as\
to fill the time of the missing light syllables. So in many cases there\
is a choice between compensatory lengthening and compensatory pause.\
\
    Thus \uc0\u8248  said the Lord \u8248  in the Vault above the Cherubim,\
    Calling to the angels and the souls in their degree:\
              "Lo! Earth has passed away\
              On the smoke of Judgment Day.\
    That Our word may be established shall We gather up the sea?"\
\
    Loud \uc0\u8248  sang the souls \u8248  of the jolly, jolly mariners:\
    "Plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee!\
            But the war is done between us,\
            In the deep the Lord hath seen us--\
    Our bones we'll leave the barracout', and God may sink the sea!"\
\
(KIPLING: _The Last Chantey._)\
\
This is an instance of a pause forming a regular part of the\
verse-rhythm. Thus in the first verse of each stanza the second and\
sixth syllables are omitted, and the result gives the characteristic\
effect of the rhythm. In measures where there is regular catalexis (that\
is, where the last light syllable of the verse is regularly omitted) the\
phenomenon is really of the same kind.\
\
    These, these will give the world another heart,\
      And other pulses. Hear ye not the hum\
    Of mighty workings?----\
      Listen awhile, ye nations, and be dumb.\
\
(Keats: _Sonnet to Haydon_.)\
\
    Call her once before you go,--\
    Call once yet!\
    In a voice that she will know,--\
    "Margaret! Margaret!"\
    Children's voices should be dear\
    (Call once more) to a mother's ear;\
    Children's voices, wild with pain,--\
    Surely she will come again!\
    Call her once, and come away;\
    This way, this way!...\
\
    Come, dear children, come away down:\
    Call no more!\
    One last look at the white-walled town,\
    And the little gray church on the windy shore;\
    Then come down!\
    She will not come, though you call all day;\
    Come away, come away!\
\
(MATTHEW ARNOLD: _The Forsaken Merman_.)\
\
In this specimen no attempt has been made to indicate the pauses, as\
different readers would interpret the verse variously. It will be found\
that this whole poem is a study in delicate changes and arrangements of\
time-intervals. The four stresses characteristic of the rhythm can be\
accounted for in such short lines as the second and tenth, properly\
read.\
\
\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[1] _Transactions of the Philological Society_, 1875-76.\
\
[2] According to a more elaborate system Mr. Ellis recognized nine\
varieties of force or stress, which he named in order as follows:\
subweak, weak, superweak, submean, mean, supermean, substrong, strong,\
superstrong. In like manner he named nine degrees each of length, pitch,\
weight, and silence. Length and Silence are both terms of duration of\
time. The meaning of Weight has not been generally understood, nor is\
the term ordinarily recognized. Mr. Ellis described it as "due to\
expression and mental conceptions of importance, resulting partly from\
expression in delivery, produced by quality of tone and gliding pitch,\
and partly from the mental effect of the constructional predominance of\
conceptions." On this whole scheme of Mr. Ellis's, Mr. Mayor remarks\
interestingly: "Whilst I admire, I with difficulty repress a shudder at\
the elaborate apparatus he has provided for registering the minutest\
variations of metrical stress. Not only does he distinguish nine\
different degrees of force, but there are the same number of degrees of\
length, pitch, silence, and weight, making altogether forty-five\
varieties of stress at the disposal of the metrist ... If the analysis\
of rhythm is so terribly complicated, let us rush into the arms of the\
intuitivists and trust to our ears only, for life is not long enough to\
admit of characterizing lines when there are forty-five expressions for\
each syllable to be considered." (_Chapters on English Metre_, p. 69.)\
\
[3] The term "wrenched" was used originally, it would seem, as one of\
reprobation. Thus Puttenham, in his _Arte of English Poesie_ (1589),\
said; "There can not be in a maker a fowler fault, than to falsifie his\
accent to serve his cadence, or by untrue orthographie to wrench his\
words to helpe his rime." (Arber ed., p. 94.)\
\
[4] It is interesting to compare with these irregular lines another\
stanza of similar form, of about the same date, from an Elegy on Edward\
I., in B\'f6ddeker's Collection, p. 140, and Wright's _Political Songs_, p.\
246.\
\
Alle \'feat beo\'fe of huerte trewe, a stounde herkne\'fe to my song of duel, \'feat\
de\'fe ha\'fe diht vs newe (\'feat make\'fe me syke ant sorewe among!) of a knyht,\
\'feat wes so strong, of wham god ha\'fe don ys wille; me \'feunche\'fe \'feat de\'fe ha\'fe\
don vs wrong, \'feat he so sone shal ligge stille.\
\
The comparatively great regularity of the measures in this second stanza\
is due to the fact that it was under the syllable-counting influence of\
the French, being in fact a translation of a French original.\
\
[5] Leigh Hunt said that "Coleridge saw the mistake which had been made\
with regard to this measure, and restored it to the beautiful freedom of\
which it was capable, by calling to mind the liberties allowed its old\
musical professors the minstrels, and dividing it by _time_ instead of\
_syllables_." (See the entire passage on _Christabel_, in the\
Introduction, on "What is Poetry?", to _Imagination and Fancy_. For a\
criticism of the metrical structure of _Christabel_, see Robert\
Bridges's _Milton's Prosody_ (ed. 1901, pp. 73-75).)\
\
\
\
\
II. THE FOOT AND THE VERSE\
\
\
English verse is commonly measured by feet, a determinate number of\
which go to form a verse or line. The foot is determined by the distance\
from one accented syllable to another in the regular scheme of the\
metre. The usual metrical feet are either dissyllabic or trisyllabic.\
The dissyllabic foot is commonly called an _iambus_ (or _iamb_) if the\
unaccented syllable precedes the accented, and a _trochee_ if the\
accented precedes the unaccented. The trisyllabic foot is commonly\
called an _anapest_ if the two unaccented syllables precede the accented\
syllable, and a _dactyl_ if they follow the accented syllable.[6] It\
will be observed that the fundamental rhythm of both iambic and trochaic\
verse is the same, as is also that of both anapestic and dactylic verse;\
the distinction belonging only to the metre as measured into regular\
lines. Iambic and anapestic verse (in which the light syllables commonly\
open the verse) are sometimes called "ascending rhythm"; trochaic and\
dactylic verse (in which the accented syllables commonly open the\
verse) "descending rhythm." Ascending rhythm is very greatly in\
predominance in English poetry.\
\
The normal verse of any poem is therefore described by indicating the\
name of the foot and the number of feet in the verse. The number of feet\
is always indicated by the number of stresses or principal accents in\
the normal verse. As the light or unaccented syllables may vary from the\
typical number, it may also be necessary to indicate that the line is\
longer than its name would imply, by reason of Feminine Ending (a light\
syllable added at the end) or Anacrusis (a light syllable prefixed); or\
that it is shorter than its name would indicate by reason of Catalexis\
or Truncation (the light syllable at the end--or less frequently at the\
beginning--being omitted).\
\
In like manner, any particular verse or line is fully described by\
indicating: (1) the typical foot; (2) the number of feet; (3) the place\
of the cesura; (4) the presence or absence of a final pause\
("end-stopped" or "run-on"); (5) the presence of such irregularities as\
\
    (_a_) Anacrusis or feminine ending,\
    (_b_) Catalexis (or truncation),\
    (_c_) Substitution of exceptional feet for the typical foot,\
    (_d_) Pauses other than the cesural.\

\
(BROWNING: _Prospice._ 1864.)\
\
These specimens, as is usual in anapestic verse, show considerable\
freedom in the treatment of the part of the foot containing the light\
syllables, substituted iambi being very common. Note the iambi in the\
Shelley stanza, line 1, second foot, and line 5, first foot. In the\
latter case, however, the first light syllable of line 5 is really\
supplied by the syllable added to make the feminine ending of line 4. In\
like manner, in the Scott stanza, the first syllable of line 8 is really\
supplied by the _-ing_ of line 7; and where we have both feminine ending\
(in line 1) and a full anapest following, the effect is that of a\
hypermetrical syllable which must be hurried over in the reading. In the\
specimen from Browning we find an iambus in the opening foot in lines 2\
and 6 (also, of course, in lines 1 and 5).\

    One more Unfortunate,\
    Weary of breath,\

(THOMAS HOOD: _The Bridge of Sighs._ ab. 1830.)\
\
Here the alternate lines are catalectic, both light syllables being\
wanting.\

    Under the Isle of Svald\
      Near to the mainland.\
\
(LONGFELLOW: _Saga of King Olaf_, xvii. 1863.)\
\
In the reading of these stanzas from Tennyson and Longfellow there is so\
marked a stress on the final syllable as to make the second dactyl\
(except in the opening lines of the Tennyson stanza) more like a Cretic\
(in the classical terminology); _i.e._ a foot made up of two heavy\
syllables with a light syllable between them. But no such foot is\
generally recognized in English verse.\

\
(BROWNING: Song in _Caliban upon Setebos_. 1864.)\
\
In the usual printing of _Caliban upon Setebos_ this song is brought\
into the form of the five-accent lines. It is evidently intended,\
however, to be read in two-accent groups. Professor Moulton has remarked\
interestingly that Browning gives the unique figure of Caliban not only\
a grammar but a prosody of his own.\
\
    Though my rime be ragged,\
    Tattered and jagged,\

\
(JOHN SKELTON: _Colyn Cloute_. ab. 1510.)\
\
This is a specimen of what Mr. Churton Collins calls "that headlong\
voluble breathless doggrel which, rattling and clashing on through\
quick-recurring rhymes, ... has taken from the name of its author the\
title of Skeltonical verse." (Ward's _English Poets_, vol. i. p. 185.)\
The number of accents, as well as the number of syllables, is irregular,\
being quite as often (perhaps more often) three as two.\
\
\
_Three-stress iambic._\
\
    O let the solid ground\
      Not fail beneath my feet\

    I shall have had my day.\

(In combination with verse of four, five, and six stresses:)\
\
      The Oracles are dumb;\
      No voice or hideous hum\
    Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.\
      Apollo from his shrine\
      Can no more divine,\
    With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving:\
      No nightly trance or breathed spell\
      Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.\
\
(MILTON: _Ode on the Morning of Christ's Nativity_. 1629.)\
\
Here, in line 5, we have an instance of a verse truncated at the\
beginning,--rare in modern English poetry.\
\
(With feminine ending:)\
\
    The mountain sheep are sweeter,\
    But the valley sheep are fatter;\
    We therefore deemed it meeter\
    To carry off the latter.\
    We made an expedition;\
    We met an host and quelled it;\
    We forced a strong position,\
    And killed the men who held it.\
\

Elphin_. 1829.)\
\
In line 2 is an instance of anacrusis.\

\

\
In this specimen lines 2, 5, 6, and 8 show initial truncation, the first\
light syllable being missing.\
\
(With two-stress verse:)\
\
    His desire is a dureless content,\
      And a trustless joy;\
    He is won with a world of despair\

      In the mind ever burning,\
    Never sick, never old, never dead,\
      From itself never turning.\
\
(SIR WALTER RALEIGH (?): _Pilgrim to Pilgrim_. In MS. Rawl. 85; in\
Schelling's _Elizabethan Lyrics_, p. 3.)\
\
"The metres of the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign are so\
overwhelmingly iambic," Professor Schelling observes, "that this\
perfectly metrical, if somewhat irregular, anap\'e6stic movement comes like\
a surprise. Professor Gummere, of Haverford College, calls my attention\
to three epigrams--printed among the poems of Raleigh, ed. Hannah, p.\
55--all of them in more or less limping anap\'e6sts, but not of this\
measure. It is quite possible that the time to which these verses were\
sung may have affected the measure." (Notes to _Elizabethan Lyrics_, pp.\
211, 212.)\
\
(With initial truncation:)\
\
    She gazed, as I slowly withdrew,\
    My path I could hardly discern;\
    So sweetly she bade me adieu,\
    I thought that she bade me return.\
\
(SHENSTONE: _Pastoral Ballad._ 1743.)\
\
Mr. Saintsbury praises highly the anapests of Shenstone (Ward's _English\
Poets_, vol. iii. p. 272), saying that he "taught the metre to a greater\
poet than himself, Cowper, and these two between them have written\
almost everything that is worth reading in it, if we put avowed parody\
and burlesque out of the question." But this is probably to be regarded\
as overstating the case.\
\
(With feminine ending:)\
\
    If you go over desert and mountain,\
      Far into the country of sorrow,\
    To-day and to-night and to-morrow,\
      And maybe for months and for years;\
      You shall come, with a heart that is bursting\
      For trouble and toiling and thirsting,\
    You shall certainly come to the fountain\
    At length,--to the Fountain of Tears.\
\
(ARTHUR O'SHAUGHNESSY: _The Fountain of Tears._ 1870.)\
\
Here the extra light syllable at the end of the line is really the\
initial light syllable of the following line, as in the specimen on p.\
29, above.\
\
    So this is a psalm of the waters,--\
    The wavering, wandering waters:\
    With languages learned in the forest,\
    With secrets of earth's lonely caverns,\
    The mystical waters go by me\
    On errands of love and of beauty,\
    On embassies friendly and gentle,\
    With shimmer of brown and of silver.\
\
(S. WEIR MITCHELL: _A Psalm of the Waters._ 1890.)\
\
Here, also, the final light syllable might be said to take the place of\
the missing initial syllable; but the structure of the verse, with the\
fact that the initial anapest is always truncated and that the final\
syllable is never accented, indicates that the verse as it stands is the\
norm of the poem--three-stress anapestic, with initial truncation and\
feminine ending.\

\
(PRIOR: _A Better Answer_. ab. 1710.)\
\
Prior's anapests well illustrate the appropriateness of the measure for\
light tripping effects, such as are sought _vers de soci\'e9t\'e9_. See also\
the measure of Goldsmith's _Retaliation_, especially the passage\
beginning--\
\
    "Here lies David Garrick, describe me who can;\
    An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man."\
\
    The small birds rejoice in the green leaves returning,\

\
    The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,\

\
(With three-stress:)\
\
    Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,\

    Thou wouldst still be ador'd, as this moment thou art,\
      Let thy loveliness fade as it will,\
    And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart\
      Would entwine itself verdantly still.\
\
(THOMAS MOORE: _Believe me, if all those endearing young charms._ ab.\
1825.)\
\
\
_four-stress dactylic_.\
\
    After the pangs of a desperate lover,\
      When day and night I have sighed all in vain;\
    Ah, what a pleasure it is to discover\
      In her eyes pity, who causes my pain!\
\
(DRYDEN: Song in _An Evening's Love_. 1668.)\
\
Of this song Mr. Saintsbury says that it is "one of the rare examples of\
a real dactylic metre in English, where the dactyls are not, as usual,\
equally to be scanned as anapests." (_Life of Dryden_, Men of Letters\
Series, p. 62.) Here, as almost always in English, the measure is\
catalectic, a final dactyl being instinctively avoided, except in short\
two-stress lines.\
\
    Warriors and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword\
    Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,\
    Heed not the corse, though a king's, in your path:\
    Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!\
\
(BYRON: _Song of Saul before his Last Battle._ 1815.)\
\
    Kentish Sir Byng stood for his King,\
    Bidding the crop-headed Parliament swing:\
    And, pressing a troop, unable to stoop\
    And see the rogues flourish and honest folk droop,\
    Marched them along, fifty-score strong,\
    Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.\
\
(BROWNING: _Cavalier Tunes._ 1843.)\
\
Here the metre is varied interestingly by pauses. Thus in lines 1 and 5\
the light syllables of the second foot are wholly wanting.\

    What, there's nothing in the moon noteworthy?\
    Nay: for if that moon could love a mortal,\
    Use, to charm him (so to fit a fancy),\
    All her magic ('tis the old sweet mythos),\
    She would turn a new side to her mortal,\
    Side unseen of herdsman, huntsman, steersman--\
    Blank to Zoroaster on his terrace,\
    Blind to Galileo on his turret,\
    Dumb to Homer, dumb to Keats--him, even!\
\
(BROWNING: _One Word More._ 1855.)\
\
This is a rare specimen of unrimed verse in other than iambic rhythm.\
\
(Catalectic:)\
\
    Then methought I heard a mellow sound,\
    Gathering up from all the lower ground;\
    Narrowing in to where they sat assembled\
    Low voluptuous music winding trembled,\
    Wov'n in circles: they that heard it sighed,\
    Panted, hand-in-hand with faces pale,\
    Swung themselves, and in low tones replied;\
    Till the fountain spouted, showering wide\
    Sleet of diamond-drift and pearly hail.\

    'Tis the weakness in strength that I cry for! my flesh, that  I seek\
    In the Godhead! I seek and I find it. O Saul, it shall be\
    A Face like my face that receives thee; a Man like to me,\
    Thou shalt love and be loved by, forever: a Hand like this hand\
    Shall throw open the gates of new life to thee! See the Christ stand!\
\
(BROWNING: _Saul._ 1845.)\
\
    Let it flame or fade, and the war roll down like a wind,\
    We have proved we have hearts in a cause, we are noble still,\
    And myself have awaked, as it seems, to the better mind;\
    It is better to fight for the good than to rail at the ill;\
    I have felt with my native land, I am one with my kind,\
    I embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assign'd.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Maud_, III. vi. 1855.)\
\
Here frequent iambi are substituted for anapests; as in line 1, second\
and fourth feet; lines 2 and 3, fifth foot; line 5, third foot.\
\
\
_Five-stress dactylic._\
\
This form is almost unknown. In the following lines we find five-stress\
catalectic verse of dactyls and trochees combined:\
\
    Surely the thought in a man's heart hopes or fears\
    Now that forgetfulness needs must here have stricken\
    Anguish, and sweetened the sealed-up springs of tears.\

        creatures fast fleeing,\
    Lift up your mind unto us that are deathless, and dateless the date\
        of our being.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _The Birds_, from Aristophanes.)\
\
Of this translation Mr. Swinburne says that it was undertaken from a\
consideration of the fact that the "marvellous metrical invention of the\
anapestic heptameter was almost exactly reproducible in a language to\
which all variations and combinations of anapestic, iambic, or trochaic\
metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of\
verse are unnatural and abhorrent." ... "I have not attempted," he says\
further, "the impossible and undesirable task of reproducing the rare\
exceptional effect of a line overcharged on purpose with a\
preponderance of heavy-footed spondees.... My main desire ... was to\
renew as far as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and\
triumphant metre, which goes ringing at full gallop as of horses who\
\
          'dance as 'twere to the music\
    Their own hoofs make.'"\
\
(_Studies in Song_, p. 68.)\
\
\
_Seven-stress dactylic._\
\
This form of verse may be said to be wanting. Schipper quotes as\
possible examples some lines which (as he remarks) seem to be made\
merely for the metrical purpose:\
\
    "Out of the kingdom of Christ shall be gathered, by angels o'er\
        Satan victorious,\
    All that offendeth, that lieth, that faileth to honor his name\
        ever glorious."\
\
(_Englische Metrik_, vol. ii. p. 419.)\
\
\
_Eight-stress iambic._\
\
This is almost unknown in English verse, because where conceivably\
occurring it shows an irresistible tendency to break up into two halves\
of four stresses each. William Webbe, in his _Discourse of English\
Poetrie_ (1586), quoted these lines as "the longest verse in length\
which I have seen used in English":\
\
    "Where virtue wants and vice abounds, there wealth is but a baited\
        hook,\
    To make men swallow down their bane, before on danger deep they\
        look."\
\
\
_Eight-stress trochaic._\
\
(Catalectic:)\
\
    Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;\
    Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.\
    Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with\
        might;\
    Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of\
        sight.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Locksley Hall._ 1842.)\
\
    Open then I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and  flutter,\
    In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.\
    Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,--\

\
    Night, in utmost noon forlorn and strong, with heart athirst and\
        fasting,\
    Hungers here, barred up forever, whence as one whom dreams affright,\
    Day recoils before the low-browed lintel threatening doom and\
        casting Night.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Night in Guernsey._)\
\
In the last line of this specimen we have a nine-accent verse,--very\
rare in English poetry.\
\
The tendency of all eight-accent lines being to break up into halves of\
four accents, the distinction between four-stress and eight-stress verse\
may be at times only a question of printing. Thus, Thackeray's _Sorrows\
of Werther_ might be regarded as eight-stress trochaic, though commonly\
printed in short lines:\
\
    "Werther had a love for Charlotte\
      Such as words could never utter.\
    Would you know how first he saw her?\
      She was cutting bread and butter."\
\
\
_Eight-stress anapestic._\
\
    Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendor\
        of winter had passed out of sight,\
    The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that\
        fulfil us in sleep with delight;\
    The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and\
        branches that glittered and swayed\
    Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow, or of frost that\
        out-lightens all flowers till it fade,\
    That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night\
        than the day, nor the day than the night,\
    Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had\
        the madness and might in thee made,\
    March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that\
        enkindle the season they smite.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _March._)\
\
\
_Eight-stress dactylic._\
\
    Onward and onward the highway runs to the distant city, impatiently\
         bearing\
    Tidings of human joy and disaster, of love and of hate, of doing\
         and daring.\
\
(LONGFELLOW: _Golden Legend_, iv. 1851.)\
\
The breathlessly continuous character of such long anapestic or\
dactylic lines may of course be interrupted, by way of relief, by the\
substitution of iambi or trochees. In the specimen from Swinburne such a\
resting-place is found in line 3, where a light syllable is omitted\
after _winds_. In the specimen from Longfellow the words _high-way_,\
_distant_, _human_, of course, fill the places of complete dactyls.\
\
\
COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS\
\
\
i. _Verses in which different sorts of feet are more or less regularly\
combined_.\
\
    In the morning, O so early, my beloved, my beloved,\
    All the birds were singing blithely, as if never they would cease:\
    'Twas a thrush sang in my garden, "Hear the story, hear the story!"\
    And the lark sang "Give us glory!" and the dove said "Give us peace."\
\
(JEAN INGELOW: _Give us Love and Give us Peace._)\
\
    Fair is our lot--O goodly is our heritage!\
    (Humble ye, my people, and be fearful in your mirth!)\
      For the Lord our God Most High\
      He hath made the deep as dry,\
    He hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the Earth!\
\
(KIPLING: _A Song of the English._)\
\
In both these specimens the full accent regularly recurs in only the\
alternate feet. Thus while the first specimen is technically\
eight-stress trochaic, there are in the normal reading of it only four\
full accents to the line. In other words the first, third, fifth, and\
seventh feet are regularly pyrrhics. (See p. 55.) The same thing appears\
in the specimen from Kipling: _ye_, _and_, _in_ (in line 2) are accented\
only in a distinctly secondary fashion. Some have suggested, for such\
rhythms as these, the recognition of a foot made up of one stressed and\
three unstressed syllables. Lanier represents such measures (in _The\
Science of English Verse_) in four-eight time.\
\
    Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,\
      The mist in my face,\
    When the snows begin, and the blasts denote\
      I am nearing the place,\
    The power of the night, the press of the storm,\
      The post of the foe;\
    Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,\
      Yet the strong man must go.\
\
(BROWNING: _Prospice._)\
\
Here the tendency is to use iambi and anapests in alternate feet; see\
especially lines 2, 3, and 5.\
\
    All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good, shall exist;\
      Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power\
    Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist\
      When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.\
\
    The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,\
      The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,\
    Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;\
      Enough that He heard it once: we shall hear it by-and-by.\
\
(BROWNING: _Abt Vogler._)\
\
Here we have a hexameter which is neither iambic nor anapestic, but a\
combination of the two rhythms. So in the following specimens\
dissyllabic and trisyllabic feet are used interchangeably.\
\
    When the lamp is shatter'd\
    The light in the dust lies dead--\
    When the cloud is scatter'd\
    The rainbow's glory is shed.\
    When the lute is broken,\
    Sweet tones are remember'd not;\
    When the lips have spoken,\
    Loved accents are soon forgot.\
\
(SHELLEY: _The Flight of Love._)\
\
    The sea is at ebb, and the sound of her utmost word\
    Is soft at the least wave's lapse in a still small reach.\
    From bay unto bay, on quest of a goal deferred,\
    From headland ever to headland and breach to breach,\
    Where earth gives ear to the message that all days preach.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _The Seaboard._)\
\
    England, none that is born thy son, and lives, by grace of thy\
        glory, free,\
    Lives and yearns not at heart and burns with hope to serve as he\
        worships thee;\
    None may sing thee: the sea-bird's wing beats down our songs as it\
        hails the sea.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _The Armada_, vii.)\
\
    This life of ours is a wild \'c6olian harp of many a joyous strain,\
    But under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail, as of souls\
        in pain.\
\
(LONGFELLOW: _The Golden Legend_, iv.)\
\
      Come away, come away, Death,\
    And in sad cypress let me be laid;\
      Fly away, fly away, breath;\
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\
    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\
              O prepare it!\
    My part of death, no one so true\
              Did share it.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Twelfth Night_, II. iv.)\
\
The characteristic irregularity in this stanza is the variation from\
trochaic to iambic rhythm. In this case the variations are in part due,\
no doubt, to the fact that the words were written for music.\
\
    Maud with her exquisite face,\
    And wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky,\
    And feet like sunny gems on an English green,\
    Maud in the light of her youth and her grace,\
    Singing of Death, and of Honor that cannot die,\
    Till I well could weep for a time so sordid and mean\
    And myself so languid and base.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Maud_, I. v.)\
\
In this specimen the characteristic rhythm of lines 1, 4, and 5 is\
dactylic, that of the remainder anapestic-iambic.\
\
    The trumpet's loud clangor\
      Excites us to arms\
    With shrill notes of anger\
      And mortal alarms.\
    The double double double beat\
      Of the thundering drum\
      Cries, hark! the foes come;\
    Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat.\
              The soft complaining flute\
              In dying notes discovers\
              The woes of helpless lovers,\
    Whose dirge is whispered by the warbling lute.\
\
(DRYDEN: _Song for St. Cecilia's Day_, 1687.)\
\
In this famous stanza the rhythm changes for obvious purposes of\
imitative representation.\
\
    Children dear, was it yesterday\
    (Call yet once) that she went away?\
    Once she sate with you and me,\
    On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,\
    And the youngest sate on her knee.\
    She combed its bright hair, and she tended it well,\
    When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.\
    She sighed, she looked up through the clear green sea;\
    She said, "I must go, for my kinsfolk pray\
    In the little gray church on the shore to-day.\
    'Twill be Easter-time in the world--ah me!\
    And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee."\
    I said, "Go up, dear heart, through the waves;\
    Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!"\
    She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.\
    Children dear, was it yesterday?\
\
    ... Down, down, down!\
    Down to the depths of the sea!\
    She sits at her wheel in the humming town,\
    Singing most joyfully.\
    Hark what she sings: "O joy, O joy,\
    For the humming street, and the child with its toy!\
    For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;\
    For the wheel where I spun,\
    And the blessed light of the sun!"\
    And so she sings her fill,\
    Singing most joyfully,\
    Till the spindle drops from her hand,\
    And the whizzing wheel stands still.\
    She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,\
    And over the sand at the sea;\
    And her eyes are set in a stare;\
    And anon there breaks a sigh,\
    And anon there drops a tear,\
    From a sorrow-clouded eye,\
    And a heart sorrow-laden,\
    A long, long sigh,\
    For the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden,\
    And the gleam of her golden hair.\
\
(MATTHEW ARNOLD: _The Forsaken Merman._)\
\
    Then the music touch'd the gates and died;\
    Rose again from where it seem'd to fail,\
    Storm'd in orbs of song, a growing gale;\
    Till thronging in and in, to where they waited,\
    As 'twere a hundred-throated nightingale,\
    The strong tempestuous treble throbbed and palpitated;\
    Ran into its giddiest whirl of sound,\
    Caught the sparkles, and in circles,\
    Purple gauzes, golden hazes, liquid mazes,\
    Flung the torrent rainbow round:\
    Then they started from their places,\
    Moved with violence, changed in hue,\
    Caught each other with wild grimaces,\
    Half-invisible to the view,\
    Wheeling with precipitate paces\
    To the melody, till they flew,\
    Hair, and eyes, and limbs, and faces,\
    Twisted hard in fierce embraces,\
    Like to Furies, like to Graces,\
    Dash'd together in blinding dew.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Vision of Sin._)\
\
\
ii. _Verses in which individual feet are altered from the metrical\
scheme._\
\
Even in metre exhibiting no marked irregularities, it is of course\
rather exceptional than otherwise to find all the feet in a verse\
conforming to the type-foot of the metre. Departures from the typical\
metre may be conveniently classified in five groups: Deficiency in\
accent; excess of accent; inversion of accent; light syllable added to\
dissyllabic foot; light syllable omitted in trisyllabic foot.\
\
Deficiency of accent is the most common of all the variations, if we\
understand by "accent" such syllabic stress as would be ordinarily\
appreciable in the reading of the word in question. It would be safe to\
say that in English five-stress iambic verse, read with only the\
ordinary etymological and rhetorical accents, twenty-five per cent of\
the verses lack the full five stresses characteristic of the type. In\
many cases, too, a foot with deficiency in stress is compensated for by\
another foot in the same verse showing excess of stress. Feet thus\
deficient in stress may conveniently be called _pyrrhics_, the pyrrhic\
being understood as made up of two unstressed syllables. This term has\
never become fully domesticated in English prosody, and some object to\
its use on the ground that we have no feet wholly without stress. Its\
use in the sense just indicated, however, seems to be an unquestionable\
convenience.\
\
Excess of accent, while less common than deficiency of accent, is even\
more easily recognizable. The foot containing two stressed syllables,\
even though one of the stresses may be distinctly stronger than the\
other, may conveniently be called a _spondee_.\
\
Inversion of accent is exceedingly familiar, especially at the beginning\
of the verse and after the medial pause. It consists, technically\
speaking, in the substitution of a trochee for an iambus or an iambus\
for a trochee (the latter very rarely).\
\
A light syllable inserted in dissyllabic measure is not unusual, though\
by no means so common as the variations previously enumerated. Such a\
syllable is frequently spoken of as "hypermetrical"; or, the variation\
may be considered as the substitution of an anapest for an iambus, in\
iambic measure, or the substitution of a dactyl for a trochee, in\
trochaic measure.\
\
The omission of one of the two light syllables from the foot in\
trisyllabic verse is so common as to make it difficult to find pure\
anapestic or dactylic verse in English. This fact is due in part to\
preference for dissyllabic measures, and in part to the usual\
indifference, in all Germanic verse, to accuracy in the number of light\
syllables. The variation may frequently be regarded as involving a\
prolongation of the light syllable of the foot, or a pause equal to the\
time of the omitted syllable; technically speaking, it consists in the\
substitution of an iambus for an anapest, or a trochee for a dactyl.\
\
Examples of all these variations may best be found in the specimens of\
verse included in the preceding pages. A few specimens of detail are\
added here, for the sake of greater clearness.\

his edition of Milton. "To smooth it" he changed the lines to read--\
\
    "Leviathan, whom God the vastest made\
    Of all the kinds that swim the ocean stream,"--\
\
not perceiving, what Cowper pointed out, that Milton had designedly used\
"the word _hugest_ where it may have the clumsiest effect....\
Smoothness was not the thing to be consulted when the Leviathan was in\
question."\

\
(BROWNING: _Paracelsus_, I.)\
\
A distinction should be made between these hypermetrical syllables which\
change the character of the foot from dissyllabic to trisyllabic, and\
syllables (in a sense hypermetrical) which are slurred or elided in the\
reading. The word _radiance_, for example, is regarded as trisyllabic in\
prose, but in the verse--\
\
    "Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned,"\
\
it is made dissyllabic by instinctive compression, and in no proper\
sense makes an anapest of the fifth foot. Of the same character are the\
numerous cases where a vowel is elided before another vowel--especially\
the vowel of the article _the_.[7] On the elisions of Milton's verse,\
see Mr. Robert Bridges's _Milton's Prosody_; on those of Shakspere's\
verse, see Abbott's _Shakespearian Grammar_. In modern verse the use of\
elision and slurring is ordinarily that found in common speech.\
\
\

                          of a presence, a form, _a might_,\
    And we heard as a prophet that hears _God's mes_sage\
                          against him, and may _not flee_.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Death of Richard Wagner._)\
\
See also specimens on pp. 42, 43, 48, above.\
\
Mr. Mayor considers the question as to how far substitution of other\
than the typical foot may be carried in a verse, without destroying the\
genuineness of the fundamental rhythm. His conclusions are these:\
\
(1) The limit of trochaic substitution is three feet out of five, with\
the final foot iambic; or two out of five, if the fifth foot is\
inverted.\
\
(2) A spondee is allowable in any position; the limit is four out of\
five, with either the fourth or fifth foot remaining iambic.\
\
(3) A pyrrhic may occur in any position; the limit is three out of five,\
with the other feet preferably spondees.\
\
(4) The limit for trisyllabic substitution is three out of five.\
\
(_Chapters on English Metre_, chap. V.)\
\
Professor Corson discusses the \'e6sthetic effect of these changes from the\
typical metre: "The true metrical artist ... never indulges in variety\
for variety's sake.... All metrical effects are to a great extent\
_relative_--and relativity of effect depends, of course, upon having a\
standard in the mind or feelings.... Now the more closely the poet\
adheres to his standard--to the even tenor (modulus) of his verse--so\
long as there is no logical nor \'e6sthetic motive for departing from it,\
the more effective do his departures become when they are sufficiently\
motived. All non-significant departures weaken the significant ones....\
The normal tenor of the verse is presumed to represent the normal tenor\
of the feeling which produces it. And departures from that normal tenor\
represent, or should represent, variations in the normal tenor of the\
feeling. Outside of the general law ... of the slurring or suppression\
of extra light syllables, which do not go for anything in the\
expression, an exceptional foot must result in emphasis, whether\
intended or not, either logical or emotional.... A great poet is\
presumed to have metrical skill; and where ripples occur in the stream\
of his verse, they will generally be found to justify themselves as\
organic; _i.e._ they are a part of the expression."\

\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[6] The names of the several kinds of feet are of course borrowed from\
classical prosody, where they are used to mark feet made up not of\
accented and unaccented, but of long and short syllables. The different\
significance of the terms as applied to the verse of different languages\
has given rise to some confusion, and it is proposed by some to abandon\
the classical terms; their use, however, seems to be too well\
established in English to permit of change. Some would even abandon the\
attempt to measure English verse by feet, contending that its rhythm is\
too free to admit of any such measuring process; thus, see Mr. J. M.\
Robertson, in the Appendix to _New Essays toward a Critical Method_, and\
Mr. J. A. Symonds in his _Blank Verse_. See also in Mr. Robert Bridges's\
_Milton's Prosody_, Appendix G "On the Use of Greek Terminology in\
English Prosody." (1901 ed. p. 77.)\
\
[7] On the historical problem of the distinction between elided and\
genuinely hypermetrical syllables in the French and English decasyllabic\
verse, see Mother\'e9: _Les th\'e9ories du vers h\'e9roique anglais et ses\
relations avec la versification fran\'e7aise_ (Havre, 1886).\

\
\
III. THE STANZA\
\
\
The stanza, or strophe, is the largest unit of verse-measure ordinarily\
recognized. It is based not so much on rhythmical divisions as on\
periods either rhetorical or melodic; that is, a short stanza will\
roughly correspond to the period of a sentence, and a long one to that\
of a paragraph, while in lyrical verse the original idea was to conform\
the stanza to the melody for which it was written. Thus Schipper\
observes: "The word strophe properly signifies a _turning_, and\
originally indicated the return of the song, as sung, to the melody with\
which it began." Schipper defines a stanza as a group of verses of a\
certain number, so combined that all the stanzas of the same poem will\
be identical in the number, the length, and the metre of the\
corresponding verses; in rimed verse, also, the arrangement of the rimes\
will be identical. (See _Grundriss_, p. 268.)\
\
The form of a stanza, then, is determined and described (the fundamental\
metre being assumed) by the number of verses, the length of verses, and\
the arrangement of rimes. The usual and convenient method of indicating\
these conditions is to represent all the verses that rime together by\
the same letter, while the number of feet in the verse is written like\
an algebraic exponent. Thus a quatrain in "common metre" (four-stress\
and three-stress lines), riming alternately, is represented by the\
formula _a^\{4\}b^\{3\}a^\{4\}b^\{3\}_.\
\
       *       *       *       *       *\
\
The appearance of the stanza in English verse is always the sign of\
foreign influence. The West Germanic verse, as far back as we have\
specimens of it, is uniformly _stichic_ (that is, marked by no periods\
save those of the individual verse), not _stanzaic_.[8] On the other\
hand, we find the stanza in the Old Norse verse. Sievers's view is that\
originally the two sorts of verse existed side by side, the stanzaic\
being preferred for chorus delivery, the stichic for individual\
recitation; one form at length crowding out the other.\
\
The great organizer of the stanza is, of course, the element of rime.\
While unrimed stanzas are familiar in classical verse, the two\
innovations, rime and stanza, were introduced together into English\

\
The _terza rima_ is, strictly speaking, a scheme of continuous verse\
rather than a stanza, each tercet being united by the rime-scheme to the\
preceding. Its use in English has always been slight, and always due to\
conscious imitation of the Italian. No successful attempt has been made\
to use it for a long poem, as Dante did in the _Divina Commedia_.\
Wyatt's specimen is the earliest in English; he chose the form for his\
three satires imitating those of Alamanni.\
\
    Once, O sweet once, I saw with dread oppressed\
    Her whom I dread; so that with prostrate lying\
    Her length the earth Love's chiefe clothing dressed.\
    I saw that riches fall, and fell a crying:--\
    Let not dead earth enjoy so deare a cover,\
    But decke therewith my soule for your sake dying;\
    Lay all your feare upon your fearfull lover:\
    Shine, eyes, on me, that both our lives be guarded:\
    So I your sight, you shall your selves recover.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Thyrsis and Dorus_, in the _Countess of Pembroke's\
Arcadia_. ab. 1580.)\
\
    Why do the Gentiles tumult, and the nations\
    Muse a vain thing, the kings of earth upstand\
    With power, and princes in their congregations\
\
    Lay deep their plots together through each land\
    Against the Lord and his Messiah dear?\
    "Let us break off," say they, "by strength of hand\
\
    Their bonds, and cast from us, no more to wear,\
    Their twisted cords." He who in Heaven doth dwell\
    Shall laugh.\
\
(MILTON: _Psalm II._ 1653.)\
\
    O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\
    Thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\
    Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,\
    Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\
    Pestilence-stricken multitudes! O thou\
    Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed\
    The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\
    Each like a corpse within its grave, until\
    Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow\
    Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill\
    (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\
    With living hues and odors plain and hill:\
    Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\
    Destroyer and Preserver; hear, oh hear!\
\
(SHELLEY: _Ode to the West Wind._ 1819.)\
\
In this case the tercets are united in groups of three to form a strophe\
of fourteen lines together with a final couplet riming with the middle\
line of the preceding tercet.\
\
    The true has no value beyond the sham:\
    As well the counter as coin, I submit,\

    Venture as warily, use the same skill,\
    Do your best, whether winning or losing it,\
\
    If you choose to play!--is my principle.\
    Let a man contend to the uttermost\
    For his life's set prize, be it what it will!\
\
(BROWNING: _The Statue and the Bust._ 1855.)\
\
The effort to translate Dante in the original metre is especially\
interesting, and marked by great difficulties; to furnish the necessary\
rimes, without introducing expletive words that mar the simplicity of\
the original, being a serious problem. The following are interesting\
specimens of translations where this problem is grappled with; the first\
is a well-known fragment, the second a portion of a still unpublished\
translation of the _Inferno_, reproduced here by the courtesy of the\
author.\

    Then she to me: "The greatest of all woes\
      Is to remind us of our happy days\
      In misery, and that thy teacher knows.\
    But if to learn our passion's first root preys\
      Upon thy spirit with such sympathy,\
      I will do even as he who weeps and says.\
    We read one day for pastime, seated nigh,\
      Of Lancelot, how love enchained him too.\
      We were alone, quite unsuspiciously.\
    But oft our eyes met, and our cheeks in hue\
      All o'er discolored by that reading were;\
      But one point only wholly us o'erthrew;\
    When we read the long-sighed-for smile of her,\
      To be thus kissed by such devoted lover,\
      He who from me can be divided ne'er\
    Kissed my mouth, trembling in the act all over.\
      Accursed was the book and he who wrote!\
      That day no further leaf did we uncover."\

(BYRON: _Francesca of Rimini_, from Dante's _Inferno_, Canto V. 1820.)\

    "Wherefore for thee I think and deem it well\
      Thou follow me, and I will bring about\
      Thy passage thither where the eternal dwell.\
    There shalt thou hearken the despairing shout,\
      Shalt see the ancient spirits with woe opprest,\
      Who craving for the second death cry out.\
    Then shalt thou those behold who are at rest\
      Amid the flame, because their hopes aspire\
      To come, when it may be, among the blest.\
    If to ascend to these be thy desire,\
      Thereto shall be a soul of worthier strain;\
      Thee shall I leave with her when I retire:\
    Because the Emperor who there doth reign,\
      For I rebellious was to his decree,\
      Wills that his city none by me attain.\
    In all parts ruleth, and there reigneth he,--\
      There is his city and his lofty throne:\
      O happy they who thereto chosen be!"\

\
(Ballad of _Robin Hood and the Monk_. In Gummere's _English Ballads_, p.\
77.)\
\
This is the familiar stanza of the early ballads. The omission of rime\
in the third line signalizes the fact that the stanza could be (and was)\
regarded indifferently as made up either of two long lines or four short\
ones. Thus the famous Chevy Chase ballad is found (Ashmole Ms., of about\
1560) written in long lines:\
\
    "The yngglyshe men hade ther bowys ybent yer hartes wer good ynoughe\
    The first off arros that the shote off seven skore spear-men the\
        sloughe."\
\
(See in Fl\'fcgel's _Neuenglisches Lesebuch_, vol. i. p. 199.)\
\
The same thing occurs also where there are two rimes to the stanza.\
Originally, the extra internal rime was no doubt the cause of the\
breaking up of the long couplet into two short lines. (See examples in\
Part Two, in the case of the septenary.)\

      The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\
\
(GRAY: _Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard._ 1751.)\
\
To Davenant's _Gondibert_ is usually traced the use of this "heroic"\
stanza (_abab_ in iambic five-stress lines) in the seventeenth and\
eighteenth centuries. In his preface the author said: "I believed it\
would be more pleasant to the reader, in a work of length, to give this\
respite or pause, between every stanza, ... than to run him out of\
breath with continued couplets. Nor doth alternate rime by any lowliness\
of cadence make the sound less heroic, but rather adapt it to a plain\
and stately composing of music." Dryden followed Davenant in using the\
stanza for his _Annus Mirabilis_, saying in his preface: "I have chosen\
to write my poem in quatrains, or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme,\
because I have ever judged them more noble, and of greater dignity, both\
for the sound and number, than any other verse in use amongst us.... I\
have always found the couplet verse most easy (though not so proper for\
this occasion), for there the work is sooner at an end, every two lines\
concluding the labor of the poet; but in quatrains he is to carry it\
further on, and not only so, but to bear along in his head the\
troublesome sense of four lines together." Dryden did not use the stanza\
again, however, and it is obviously unsuited to a long narrative poem.\
Saintsbury says: "With regard to the nobility and dignity of this\
stanza, it may safely be said that _Annus Mirabilis_ itself, the best\
poem ever written therein, killed it by exposing its faults.... It is\
chargeable with more than the disjointedness of the couplet, without the\
possibility of relief; while, on the other hand, the quatrains have not,\
like the Spenserian stave or the _ottava rima_, sufficient bulk to form\
units in themselves." (_Life of Dryden_, Men of Letters Series, p. 34.)\
\
It is hard to say what Mr. Saintsbury means in speaking of the _Annus\
Mirabilis_ as the best poem ever written in the heroic quatrain, when we\
remember that it is the quatrain of Gray's _Elegy_. On the possible\
sources of his use of it, see Gosse's _Life of Gray_, in the Men of\
Letters Series, p. 98 (also his _From Shakespeare to Pope_, p. 140). Mr.\
Gosse refers to the use of the quatrain by Sir John Davies in the _Nosce\
Teipsum_ (1599), with which Gray was familiar, and (in addition to\
Davenant, Dryden, and Hobbes's _Homer_) to the _Love Elegies_ of James\
Hammond, published 1743. "It is believed that the printing of Hammond's\
verses incited Gray to begin his _Churchyard Elegy_, and to make the\
four-line stanza the basis of most of his harmonies.... The measure\
itself, from first to last, is an attempt to render in English the\
solemn alternation of passion and reserve, the interchange of imploring\
and desponding tones, that is found in the Latin elegiac; and Gray gave\
his poem, when he first published it, an outward resemblance to the text\
of Tibullus by printing it without any stanzaic pauses." Mr. Gosse\
neglects the elegies of William Shenstone, which were also in the\
quatrain, and some of which had apparently been published before the\
_Churchyard Elegy_. On this matter see Beers's _Romanticism in the\
Eighteenth Century_, p. 137, where Shenstone is said to have borrowed\
the stanza from Hammond, and Gray from Shenstone. Shenstone, in his\
_Prefatory Essay on Elegy_, defended the metrical form and referred to\
the elegies of Hammond. "Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, seems well\
enough adapted to this species of poetry; and, however exceptionable\
upon other occasions, its inconveniencies appear to lose their weight in\
shorter elegies, and its advantages seem to acquire an additional\
importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a\
collection of elegies not long since published." (Chalmers's _English\
Poets_, vol. xiii. p. 264.)\
\
    For there was Milton like a seraph strong,\
      Beside him Shakespeare bland and mild;\
    And there the world-worn Dante grasped his song,\

    From belt to belt of crimson seas\
      On leagues of odor streaming far,\
      To where in yonder orient star\
    A hundred spirits whisper "Peace."\
\
(TENNYSON: _ibid._, lxxxiv.)\
\
This stanza (_abba_ in four-stress iambics) is commonly known as the\
"_In Memoriam_ stanza," from its familiar use by Tennyson. Tennyson is\
indeed said to have invented it for his own use, not knowing of its\
earlier appearance in the works of Jonson and Rossetti. Professor Corson\
has an interesting passage on the poetic quality of the stanza: "By the\
rhyme-scheme of the quatrain, the terminal rhyme-emphasis of the stanza\
is reduced, the second and third verses being most closely braced by the\
rhyme. The stanza is thus admirably adapted to that sweet continuity of\
flow, free from abrupt checks, demanded by the spiritualized sorrow\
which it bears along. Alternate rhyme would have wrought an entire\
change in the tone of the poem. To be assured of this, one should read,\
aloud of course, all the stanzas whose first and second, or third and\
fourth, verses admit of being transposed without affecting the sense. By\
such transposition, the rhymes are made alternate, and the concluding\
rhymes more emphatic." Compare the stanza quoted above from section\
xxvii. with the transposed form:\
\
    "I feel it when I sorrow most;\
      I hold it true, whate'er befall;\
    'Tis better to have loved and lost\
      Than never to have loved at all."\
\
On the passage quoted from section lxxxiv. Professor Corson also\
observes: "The four stanzas of which it is composed constitute but one\
period, the sense being suspended till the close. The rhyme-emphasis is\
so distributed that any one, hearing the poem read, would hardly be\
sensible of any of the slightest checks in the continuous and even\
movement of the verse.... There is no other section of _In Memoriam_ in\
which the artistic motive of the stanza is so evident." (_Primer of\
English Verse_, pp. 70-77.)\

\
Here the third line (the same in all the stanzas) has an additional\
internal rime.\

REFRAIN STANZAS\
\
In this group of refrain stanzas there is no attempt to make the range\
of illustrations complete, but only to suggest how the refrain idea has\
been variously used in forming the structure of the stanza. In some\
cases, for example, it will be seen that the refrain is a mere appendage\
or _coda_ to the stanza; in others it is made by rime a part of the\
organized structure.\

\
The special form of refrain stanza appearing in the first of these\
foreign specimens (the Alleluia hymn form) is generally thought to have\
been the source of the "tail-rime stanza" illustrated in the other two\
specimens, and in the several pages which follow. The characteristic\
feature of this stanza is the presence of two short lines riming\
together and serving as "tails" to the first and second parts of the\
body of the stanza. The same name appears in all the languages: "versus\
caudati" in the medi\'e6val Latin, "rime cou\'e9e" in the French, and\
"Schweifreim" in modern German. It is easy to see, what the following\
specimens illustrate, how stanzas constructed on this fundamental\
principle might be varied greatly in particular forms, according to the\
number, length, and rime-arrangement of the longer lines.\
\
    Men may merci have, traytour not to save, for luf ne for awe,\

(ROBERT MANNING of Brunne: _Chronicle._ ab. 1330.)\
\

    \'dee Baliol did him mede\
             a wikked bounte.\

    and on our geste to spede\
             a Maddok \'feer left we.  (_Ibid._)\
\
Manning's chronicle was a translation of the French chronicle of Pierre\
de Langtoft. Although the translator designed to avoid the various\
complicated measures used in the original, and kept pretty closely to\
alexandrines (see p. 254, below), in the passages here represented he\
followed the tail-rime of the original. In the first case the stanza\
form is not represented in the manuscript, though of course implicit in\
the rimes. The name of the stanza, "rime cou\'e9e," appears very early in\
Manning's Prologue, in the famous passage in which he expressed his\
preference for metrical simplicity:\
\
    Als \'feai haf wrytenn and sayd\
    Haf I alle in myn Inglis layd,\
    In symple speche as I couthe,\
    That is lightest in mannes mouthe.\
    I mad noght for no disours,\
    Ne for no seggers no harpours,\
    Bot for \'fee luf of symple menn\
    That strange Inglis cann not kenn.\
    For many it ere that strange Inglis\
    In ryme wate never what it is,\
    And bot \'feai wist what it mente\
    Ellis me thoght it were alle shente.\
\
    I made it not for to be praysed,\
    Bot at \'fee lewed menn were aysed.\
    If it were made in ryme couwee,\
    Or in strangere or entrelace,\
    \'deat rede Inglis it ere inowe\
    \'deat couthe not haf coppled a kowe,\
    \'deat outhere in couwee or in baston\
    Som suld haf ben fordon,\
    So \'feat fele men \'feat it herde\
    Suld not witte howe \'feat it ferde.\
\
    ... And forsoth I couth noght\
    So strange Inglis as \'feai wroght,\
    And menn besoght me many a tyme\
    To turne it bot in light ryme.\
    \'feai sayd, if I in strange it turne,\
    To here it manyon suld skurne.\
    For it ere names fulle selcouthe,\
    \'feat ere not used now in mouthe.\
    And therfore for the comonalte,\
    \'feat blythely wild listen to me,\
    On light lange I it begann,\
    For luf of the lewed mann.\
\
(Hearne ed., vol. i. pp. xcix, c.)\
\
Lines 15-22 may be paraphrased thus: "If it were made in _rime cou\'e9e_,\
in _rime strangere_, or _rime entrelac\'e9e_, there are plenty of those who\
read English who could not have put the tail-verses together; so that\
either in the tail-verse or the _baston_ some would have been confused,\
and many men that heard it would not know how it went." The "interlaced"\
(alternate) rime was a familiar form. _Baston_ seems usually to be an\
equivalent for "stanza" or "stave." It seems uncertain whether by _rime\
strangere_ Manning had in mind any particular form of stanza or\
rime-arrangement.\

    And to an elf-queen I me take\

\
(CHAUCER: _Sir Thopas_, from _Canterbury Tales_. ab. 1385.)\
\
The tail-rime stanza had become a favorite for the metrical romances of\
the fourteenth century; but Chaucer evidently saw its inappropriateness\
for long narrative poems, and ridiculed it--with certain other elements\
of the romances--in this _Rime of Sir Thopas_. The Host is made to\
interrupt the story:\
\

\
(_Quinque Gaudia._ In M\'e4tzner's _Altenglische Sprachproben_, vol. i. p.\

\
Here the principle of the tail-rime is extended to four tail-verses. See\
also the specimen on p. 111, below.\

The stanzas that follow show various combinations and applications of\
the same principle--the use of shorter verses in connection with longer.\

    Under the walls of Paradise!\
\
(THOMAS BUCHANAN READ: _Drifting._ ab. 1850.)\
\
In these stanzas a pair of long lines bind together the first and second\
parts of the composition, just as the short lines do in the original\
_rime cou\'e9e_.\
\
Young was and is universally condemned for choosing this form of stanza\
for his odes. He was led to do so by his admiration for the passage in\
Dryden's _Ode for St. Cecilia's Day_, running:\
\
       "Assumes the god,\
        Affects to nod,\
    And seems to shake the spheres."\
\
Here, said Young, Dryden was expressing "majesty"; hence, since he\
wished his odes to be majestic, he used the short, choppy measure\
throughout. (See his Introductory Essay to his Odes, in Chalmers's\
_English Poets_, vol. xiii.) On the other hand, the stanza as used by\
Read has been almost universally admired.\
\
    Hail, old Patrician Trees, so great and good!\

      Of strenuous flight must die.\

    Whence floweth Helicon, the learned well,\
      Help me to blaze\
      Her worthy praise,\
    Which in her sex doth all excel.\

(CAREW: _In Praise of his Mistress._ ab. 1635.)\

    When I resemble her to thee,\
    How sweet and fair she seems to be.\
\
(WALLER: _Go, lovely Rose._ ab. 1650.)\
\
The use of short lines somewhat intricately introduced among longer\
ones, is characteristic of the stanzas of the lyrical poets of the\
first part of the seventeenth century. It may perhaps be traced in part\
to the influence of Donne.\
\
    Where the quiet-colored end of evening smiles\

\
Compare with this (although it is not divided into stanzas) Herrick's\
_Thanksgiving to God_:\
\
    Lord, thou hast given me a cell\
      Wherein to dwell;\
    A little house, whose humble roof\
      Is weatherproof;\
    Under the spars of which I lie\
      Both soft and dry.\
\
        When God at first made Man,\
    Having a glass of blessings standing by,\

\
The "rime royal" stanza is one of Chaucer's contributions to English\
verse, and about 14,000 lines of his poetry are in this form. Its use by\
King James in the _King's Quhair_ was formerly thought to be the source\
of the name; but it seems more likely that the name, like the form, was\
of French origin, and is to be connected with such terms as _chant\
royal_ and _ballat royal_, familiar in the nomenclature of courtly\
poetry (see Schipper, vol. i. p. 426). The stanza was used by Chaucer\
with marvellous skill for purposes of continuous narrative, and was a\
general favorite among his imitators in the fifteenth century, being\
used by Lydgate, Occleve, Hawes, Dunbar, then by Skelton, and by Barclay\
in the _Ship of Fooles_. It appears popular as late as the time of\
Sackville's part of the _Mirror for Magistrates_ (1563).[9] Later than\
Shakspere's _Rape of Lucrece_ it is rarely found. (But see Milton's\
unfinished poem on _The Passion_, where he used a form of the rime royal\
with concluding alexandrine.)\
\
Strictly speaking, the "rime royal" is always in five-stress verse, but\
in the following specimen the same rime-scheme appears in the irregular\
six-or-seven-stress verse of one of the Mysteries.\

This stanza is sometimes called the "_Monk's Tale_ stanza," from its use\
by Chaucer in that single tale of the Canterbury group. Although it has\
been little used by later poets, it may have given Spenser a suggestion\
for his characteristic stanza (see below, p. 102).\

\
    She sat, and sewed, that hath done me the wrong\
    Whereof I plain, and have done many a day;\
    And, whilst she heard my plaint in piteous song,\
    She wished my heart the sampler, that it lay.\
    The blind master, whom I have served so long,\
    Grudging to hear that he did hear her say,\
    Made her own weapon do her finger bleed,\
    To feel if pricking were so good in deed.\
\
(SIR THOMAS WYATT: _Of his love that pricked her finger with a needle_,\
in Tottel's _Songs and Sonnets_. pub. 1557.)\
\
This _ottava rima_ is a familiar Italian stanza made classic by Ariosto\
and Tasso, and introduced into England by Wyatt, together with the\
sonnet and other Italian forms. Professor Corson says, "Such a\
rhyme-scheme, especially in the Italian, with its great similarity of\
endings, is too 'monotonously iterative'; and the rhyming couplet at the\
close seems, as James Russell Lowell expresses it, 'to put on the brakes\
with a jar.'" (_Primer of English Verse_, pp. 89 f.)\

    Ne runs in perill of foes cruell knife,\
    That in the sacred temples he may reare\
    A trophee of his glittering spoyles and treasure,\
    Or may abound in riches above measure.\

    With like revenge; and neither party bow'd:\
    Fronting each other with confounding blows,\
    No wound one sword unto the other owes.\

    And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills,\
    And now was dropt into the western bay:\
    At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue:\

\
(MILTON: _Lycidas_; Epilogue. 1638.)\
\
This is a single stave of the _ottava rima_, at the close of the varying\
metrical forms of _Lycidas_. Professor Corson says: "The Elegy having\
come to an end, the _ottava rima_ is employed, with an admirable\
artistic effect, to mark off the Epilogue in which Milton ... speaks in\
his own person."\
\
    They looked a manly, generous generation;\
    Beards, shoulders, eyebrows, broad, and square, and thick,\
    Their accents firm and loud in conversation,\
    Their eyes and gestures eager, sharp, and quick,\
    Showed them prepared, on proper provocation,\
    To give the lie, pull noses, stab and kick;\
    And for that very reason, it is said,\
    They were so very courteous and well-bred.\
\
(JOHN HOOKHAM FRERE: _The Monks and the Giants._ 1817.)\
\
    With every morn their love grew tenderer,\
    With every eve deeper and tenderer still;\
    He might not in house, field, or garden stir,\
    But her full shape would all his seeing fill;\
    And his continual voice was pleasanter\
    To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;\
    Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,\
    She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.\
\
(KEATS: _Isabella._ 1820.)\
\
    As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,\
    And wished that others held the same opinion;\
    They took it up when my days grew more mellow,\
    And other minds acknowledged my dominion:\

    Leaf," and Imagination droops her pinion,\
    And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk\
    Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.\
\
(BYRON: _Don Juan_, canto iv. st. 3. 1821.)\
\
Of the _ottava rima_, as used by Frere and Byron, Austin Dobson says:\
"It had already been used by Harrington, Drayton, Fairfax, and (as we\
have seen) in later times by Gay; it had even been used by Frere's\
contemporary, William Tennant; but to Frere belongs the honor of giving\
it the special characteristics which Byron afterward popularised in\
_Beppo_ and _Don Juan_. Structurally the _ottava rima_ of Frere\
singularly resembles that of Byron, who admitted that _Whistlecraft_ was\
his 'immediate model.' ... Byron, taking up the stanza with equal skill\
and greater genius, filled it with the vigor of his personality, and\
made it a measure of his own, which it has ever since been hazardous for\
inferior poets to attempt." (Ward's _English Poets_, vol. iv. p. 240.)\
Byron may indeed be said--in the words of the present specimen--to have\
turned what was commonly a romantic stanza "to burlesque."\

\
(SPENSER: _ib._ bk. i. canto 1, st. 41.)\
\
This stanza, which Spenser invented for his own use and to which his\
name is always given, was apparently formed by adding an alexandrine to\
the _ababbcbc_ stanza of Chaucer. In it Spenser wrote the greater part\
of his poetry, and its use marks the Spenserian influence wherever\
found, especially among the poets of the eighteenth century,--Thomson,\
Shenstone, Beattie, and the like.\
\
James Russell Lowell, in his Essay on Spenser, comments as follows: "He\
found the _ottava rima_ ... not roomy enough, so first ran it over into\
another line, and then ran that added line over into an alexandrine, in\
which the melody of one stanza seems forever longing and feeling forward\
after that which is to follow.... Wave follows wave with equable\
gainings and recessions, the one sliding back in fluent music to be\
mingled with and carried forward by the next. In all this there is\
soothingness, indeed, but no slumberous monotony; for Spenser was no\
mere metrist, but a great composer. By the variety of his pauses--now at\
the close of the first or second foot, now of the third, and again of\
the fourth--he gives spirit and energy to a measure whose tendency it\
certainly is to become languorous." (_Works_, vol. iv. pp. 328, 329.)\
\
See also the chapters on the Spenserian stanza in Corson's _Primer of\
English Verse_, where its use for pictorial effects is interestingly\
discussed.\
\
      A pleasing land of drowsy-head it was,\
      Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye,\
      And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\
      Forever flushing round a summer sky:\
      There eke the soft delights, that witchingly\
      Instil a wanton sweetness through the breast,\
      And the calm pleasures always hovered nigh;\
      But whate'er smacked of noyaunce, or unrest,\
    Was far far off expelled from this delicious nest.\
\

      Emblem right meet of decency does yield:\
      Her apron dyed in grain, as blue, I trowe,\
      As is the hare-bell that adorns the field:\
      And in her hand, for sceptre, she does wield\
      Tway birchen sprays, with anxious fear entwined,\
      With dark distrust and sad repentance filled,\
      And stedfast hate, and sharp affliction joined,\
    And fury uncontrolled and chastisement unkind.\
\
(SHENSTONE: _The Schoolmistress._ 1742.)\
\
Thomson's _Castle of Indolence_, although not published till 1748, seems\
to have been written and circulated before Shenstone's _Schoolmistress_.\
Thomson caught the spirit of Spenser and his stanza better than any\
other imitator until the days of Keats. On the revival of the stanza at\
this period, see Beers's _English Romanticism in the Eighteenth\
Century_, chap. iii., on "the Spenserians." Earliest of the group,\
according to Mr. Gosse, was Akenside's _Virtuoso_ (1737. See _Eighteenth\
Century Literature_, p. 311).\

      A thousand years their cloudy wings expand\
      Around me, and a dying glory smiles\
      O'er the far times, when many a subject land\
      Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,\

      Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,\
      As are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings;\
      And in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries,\
      And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,\
    A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings.\
\
(KEATS: _Eve of St. Agnes._ 1820.)\
\
Professor Corson remarks: "Probably no English poet who has used the\
Spenserian stanza, first assimilated so fully the spirit of Spenser, ...\
as did Keats; and to this fact may be partly attributed his effective\
use of it as an organ for his imagination in its 'lingering, loving,\
particularizing mood.'" (_Primer of English Verse_, p. 124.)\
\
      The splendors of the firmament of time\
      May be eclips'd, but are extinguish'd not;\
      Like stars to their appointed height they climb,\
      And death is a low mist which cannot blot\
      The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought\
      Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair,\
      And love and life contend in it for what\
      Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there\
    And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.\
\
(SHELLEY: _Adonais_, st. 44. 1821.)\
\
With reference to his use of this stanza Shelley remarked, in the\
Preface to _The Revolt of Islam_: "I have adopted the stanza of Spenser\
(a measure inexpressibly beautiful), not because I consider it a finer\
model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of Shakespeare and\
Milton, but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity:\
you must either succeed or fail.... But I was enticed also by the\
brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been\
nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious\
arrangement of the pauses of this measure." Professor Corson (_Primer of\
English Verse_, p. 112) quotes Mr. Todhunter as saying: "Compare the\
impetuous rapidity and pale intensity of Shelley's verse with the\
lulling harmony, the lingering cadence, the voluptuous color of\
Spenser's, or with the grandiose majesty of Byron's.... In _Adonais_,\
indeed, a poem on which he bestowed much labor, he handles the stanza in\
a masterly manner, and endows it with an individual music beautiful and\
new."\
\
      "Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land,\
      "This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."\
      In the afternoon they came unto a land\
      In which it seemed always afternoon.\
      All round the coast the languid air did swoon,\
      Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.\
      Full-faced above the valley stood the moon;\
      And like a downward smoke, the slender stream\
    Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.\

(PHINEAS FLETCHER: _Piscatory Eclogues._ ab. 1630.)\

Fletcher was an imitator of Spenser, and here devises a stanza differing\

effect. For other instances of final alexandrines, doubtless used under\

(_The Pearl_, st. xi. Fourteenth century.)\
\
Mr. Israel Gollancz says, in his Introduction to this poem: "I can point\
to no direct source to which the poet of _Pearl_ was indebted for his\
measure; that it ultimately belongs to Romance poetry I have little\
doubt. These twelve-line verses seem to me to resemble the earliest form\
of the sonnet more than anything else I have as yet discovered.... Be\
this as it may, all will, I hope, recognize that there is a distinct\
gain in giving to the 101 stanzas of the poem the appearance of a sonnet\
sequence, marking clearly the break between the initial octave and the\
closing quatrain.... The refrain, the repetition of the catch-word of\
each verse, the trammels of alliteration, all seem to have offered no\
difficulty to our poet; and if power over technical difficulties\
constitutes in any way a poet's greatness, the author of _Pearl_, from\
this point of view alone, must take high rank among English poets."\
(Introduction, pp. xxiv, xxv.)\

Other examples of intricate stanza structure are found in _Sir Gawain\
and the Green Knight_, supposed to be by the author of _Pearl_. See in\

\
This and the two following specimens, together with some included\
earlier under the head of Tail-Rime, illustrate the interest in complex\
lyrical measures characteristic of the period of French influence in the\
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In 1152 Henry of Normandy (who\
ascended the throne in 1154) married Eleanor of Poitou, and in her train\
there came to England the great troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn. On the\
poems of this troubadour and others of the same school, see ten Brink's\
_English Literature_, Kennedy translation, vol. i. pp. 159-164. Other\
troubadours followed, and found a home in the court of Richard the\
Lion-Hearted, who himself entered the ranks of the poets. The result was\
a great mass of Norman French lyrical poetry, often in intricate forms,\
and a smaller mass of imitative lyrics in Middle English. As Schipper\
observes, the elaborate lyrical forms were inconsistent with English\
taste, and it was only the simpler ones which were widely adopted. On\
the general character of the Romance stanza-forms, and their influence\
in England, see Schipper, vol. i. pp. 309 ff.\

(Epilogue of Brome Play of Abraham and Isaac. In Manly's _Specimens of\
the Pre-Shaksperean Drama_, vol. i. p. 56.)\
\
This verse of the early Mystery Plays and connected forms of the drama\
shows an extraordinary variety of measures. In general, the effort of\
the writers seems to have been to show some artistic ingenuity of\
structure, and at the same time keep to the free popular dialogue verse\
which was associated with the plays. We find, therefore, tumbling verse,\
alexandrines, septenaries, and intricate strophic forms, all commonly\
written with slight regard for syllable-counting principles.\
\
\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[8] There is a single well-known exception: the Anglo-Saxon poem known\
as _Deor's Lament_, which is divided into irregularly varying strophes,\
all ending with the same refrain. (See ten Brink's _English Literature_,\
Kennedy translation, vol. i, p. 60.) See also on the strophic formation\
of the First Riddle of Cynewulf, an article by W. W. Lawrence, in\

\
\
\
\
IV. TONE-QUALITY\
\
\
The quality of the sounds of the words used in verse, although in no way\
concerned in the rhythm, is an element of some importance. The\
sound-quality may be used in either of two ways: as a regular\
co\'f6rdinating element in the structure of the verse, or as a sporadic\
element in the beauty or melody of the verse.\
\
\
A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT\
\
In this capacity, similar qualities of sound indicate co\'f6rdinated parts\
of the verse-structure, thus emphasizing the idea of similarity\
(corresponding to that of symmetry in arts expressed in space) which is\
at the very basis of rhythmical composition.\
\
Obviously, the similarity may exist between vowel sounds, consonant\
sounds, or both; more specifically, it is found either in initial\
consonants, in accented vowels, or in accented vowels plus final\
consonants. Properly speaking, the term Rime is applicable to all three\
cases; the first being distinguished as initial rime or Alliteration\
(German _Anreim_ or _Stabreim_); the second as Assonance (_Stimmreim_),\
the third as complete Rime (_Vollreim_). English usage commonly reserves\
the term Rime for the third class.\
\
\
i. _Assonance_\
\
Assonance was the characteristic co\'f6rdinating element in the verse of\
the early Romance languages, the Proven\'e7al, Old French, and Spanish.\
Thus in the _Chanson de Roland_ (eleventh century) we find the verses of\
each _laisse_, or strophe, bound together by assonance. Frequently this\
develops into full rime by chance or convenience. The following is a\
characteristic group of verses from the _Roland_:\
\
    Li reis Marsilies esteit en Sarragoce.\
    Alez en est un vergier soz l'ombre;\
    Sor un pedron de marbre bloi se colchet:\
    Environ lui at plus de vint milie homes.\
    Il en apelet et ses dus et ses contes:\
    "Odez, seignor, quels pechiez nos encombret.\
    Li emperedre Charles de France dolce\
    En cest pais nos est venuz confondre."\
\
The following specimen of Old Spanish verse shows the nature of\
assonance as regularly used in that language:\
\
    Fablo myo \'c7id bien e tan mesurado:\
    "Grado a ti, se\'f1or padre, que estas en alto!\
    Esto me han buelto myos enemigos malos."\
    Alli pieussan de aguijar, alli sueltan las rriendas.\
    A la exida de Bivar ovieron la corneja diestra,\
    E entrando a Burgos ovieron la siniestra.\
    Me\'e7io myo \'c7id los ombros e engrameo la tiesta:\
    "Albricia, Albarffanez, ca echados somos de tierra!"\
\
(_Poema del Cid._ Twelfth century.)\
\
    Maiden, crowned with glossy blackness,\
      Lithe as panther forest-roaming,\
    Long-armed naiad, when she dances,\
      On a stream of ether floating,--\
            Bright, O bright Fedalma!\
\
    Form all curves like softness drifted,\
      Wave-kissed marble roundly dimpling,\
    Far-off music slowly winged,\
        Gently rising, gently sinking,--\
            Bright, O bright Fedalma!\
\
(GEORGE ELIOT: Song from _The Spanish Gypsy_, book i.)\
\
This song was written in avowed imitation of the Spanish verse,\
illustrating its prevailingly trochaic rhythm as well as alliteration.\
Elsewhere verse bound together only by assonance is almost unknown in\
English poetry. In the _Contemporary Review_ for November, 1894, Mr.\
William Larminie has an interesting article giving a favorable account\
of the use of assonance in Celtic (Irish) verse, and proposing its\
larger use in English poetry, as a relief from the--to him--almost\
cloying elaborateness of rime.\
\
In the following specimen, assonance seems in some measure to take the\
place of rime.\
\
    Haply, the river of Time--\
    As it grows, as the towns on its marge\
    Fling their wavering lights\
    On a wider, statelier stream--\
    May acquire, if not the calm\
    Of its early mountainous shore,\
    Yet a solemn peace of its own.\
\
    And the width of the waters, the hush\
    Of the gray expanse where he floats,\
    Freshening its current and spotted with foam\
    As it draws to the ocean, may strike\
    Peace to the soul of the man on its breast,--\
    As the pale waste widens around him,\
    As the banks fade dimmer away,\
    As the stars come out, and the night-wind\
    Brings up the stream\
    Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea.\
\
(MATTHEW ARNOLD: _The Future._)\
\
\
ii. _Alliteration_\
\
Alliteration appears sporadically in the verse of all literary\
languages, but as a means for the co\'f6rdination of verse it is\
characteristic of the primitive Germanic tongues.\
\
    Hw\'e6t! we nu gehyrdan, hu \'fe\'e6t h\'e6lubearn\
    \'deurh his hydercyme hals eft forgeaf,\

    \'derynysse \'ferym, \'feonc butan ende!\
\
(CYNEWULF: _Crist._ ll. 586-599. Eighth century.)\
\
This specimen represents the use of alliteration in the most regularly\
constructed Anglo-Saxon verse. The two half-lines are united into the\
long line by the same initial consonant in the important syllables. In\
the first half-line the alliteration is on the two principally stressed\
syllables, or on one of them alone (most frequently the first); in the\
second half-line it is commonly found only on the first. Alliterating\
unstressed syllables are usually regarded as merely accidental. Any\
initial vowel sound alliterates with any other vowel sound.\
\
The most regular verse appears in Anglo-Saxon poetry of what may be\
called the classical period,--700 A.D. and for a century\
following,--represented by _Beowulf_ and the poems of Cynewulf. By the\
time of \'c6lfric, who wrote about 1000 A.D., there appear signs of a\
breaking in the regular verse-form. (See Schipper, vol. i. pp. 60 ff.)\
For example, two alliterative syllables often appear in the second\
half-line; one half-line may be without alliteration; alliteration may\
bind different long-lines together; or alliteration may be altogether\
wanting. There are also additions of many light syllables, resulting\
almost, as Schipper observes, in rhythmical prose. These tendencies\
resulted in the wholly irregular use of alliteration appearing in much\
of the verse of the early Middle English period, illustrated in the\
specimens that follow.\
\
       *       *       *       *       *\
\
The origins of alliteration in Germanic verse are lost in the general\
mass of Germanic origins. It is almost universally regarded as a purely\
native development, although M. Kawczynski (_Essai Comparatif sur\
l'Origine et l'Histoire des Rythmes_; Paris, 1889) sets forth the\
remarkable opinion that the Germans derived their alliteration from the\
Romans. "We must remember," he says, "the schools of rhetoric existing\
in Gaul in the sixth and seventh centuries, where alliteration seems to\
have been held in esteem.... It became more and more frequent in the\
Latin poetry of the Carlovingian period, and it will suffice to cite\
here the following verses from Milo of Saint Amand:\
\
    'Pastores pecum primi pressique pavore\
    Conspicuos cives carmen caeleste canentes\
    Audivere astris arrectis auribus; auctor\
    Ad terras ...'\
\
It early passed to Ireland, and the Irish made use of it in their Latin\
poetry and in their national poetry. The example of the Irish was\
followed by the Anglo-Saxons, although these last had derived the same\
rules from the Latin writers.... The Anglo-Saxons, who sent the second\
series of apostles to the Germans, taught them the use of alliteration\
in poetry. The Scandinavians, on their side, learned it also from the\
Anglo-Saxons." This theory has found no adherents among scholars, and M.\
Kawczynski's illustrations are probably most useful in emphasizing the\
natural pleasure in similarity of sound found among all peoples. See\
below, on the related question of the origin of end-rime.\
\

\
(LAYAMON: _Brut_, ll. 2912-2931. Madden ed., vol. i. p. 123. ab. 1200.)\
\
The _Brut_ of Layamon represents typically the transition period, when\
alliteration and end-rime were struggling for the mastery in English\
verse. Schipper points out that we find in the poem four kinds of lines:\
\
1. Simple alliterative lines in more or less strict adherence to the old\
rules.\
\
2. Lines combining alliteration and rime or alliteration and assonance.\
\
3. Lines showing rime or assonance, without alliteration.\
\
4. Four-stress lines with neither rime nor alliteration.\
\
The present specimen shows the preference for alliteration; that on p.\
127, below, represents the introduction of rime.\

\
(WILLIAM LANGLAND (?): _Piers the Plowman_, Prologue, ll. 1-10. B-text.\
Fourteenth century.)\
\
_Piers the Plowman_ represents the revival of the alliterative long\
line, with fairly strict adherence to the old rules, by contemporaries\
of Chaucer, in the fourteenth century. For this verse, see further in\
Part Two, pp. 155, 156.\

     cxlix and clxxii, and T. F. Henderson's _Scottish Vernacular\
     Literature_, pp. 153-164.\
\
Alliteration as an organic element of verse was especially favored in\
the North country, and its popularity in Scotland--illustrated in the\
present specimen from Dunbar--considerably outlasted its use in England.\
The famous words of Chaucer's Parson will be recalled:\
\
    "But trusteth wel, I am a Southren man,\
    I can nat geste--rum, ram, ruf--by lettre."\
\
We find King James, as late as 1585 (_Reulis and Cautelis_), giving the\
following instructions: "Let all your verse be Literall, sa far as may\
be, ... bot speciallie Tumbling verse for flyting. By Literall I meane,\
that the maist part of your lyne sall rynne upon a letter, as this\
tumbling lyne rynnis upon F:\
\
    _Fetching fude for to feid it fast furth of the Farie._"\
\
The following specimen is one of the latest examples of fairly regular\
alliterative verse, written in England, that has come down to us. It is\
from a ballad of the battle of Flodden Field (1513).\
\
    Archers uttered out their arrowes, and egerlie they shotten.\
    They proched us with speares, and put many over,\
    That the blood outbrast at there broken harnish.\
    There was swinging out of swords, and swapping of headds;\
    We blanked them with bills through all their bright armor,\
    That all the dale dunned of their derfe strokes.\
\
(_Scotishe Ffielde_, from Percy's Folio MS. In FL\'dcGEL'S _Neuenglisches\
Lesebuch_, vol. i. p. 156.)\
\
\
iii. _Rime_ (_i.e. end-rime_)\
\
Full rime, or end-rime, involves the principally stressed vowel in the\
riming word, and all that follows that vowel. When there is an entire\
unstressed syllable following, the rime is called double, or feminine.\
Triple rime is also recognized, though rare.[11] End-rime being a\
stranger to the early Germanic languages, its appearance in any of them\
may commonly be taken as a sign of foreign influence. In general, of\
course, rime and the stanza were introduced together into English verse,\
under the influence of Latin hymns and French lyrics.\
\
The functions of rime in English verse may perhaps be grouped under\
three heads: the function of emphasis, the function of forming beautiful\
or pleasurable sounds, and the function of combining or organizing the\
verses. It is with reference to the first of these that Professor Corson\
speaks of rime as "an enforcing agency of the individual verse." Under\
the second head rime is considered simply as a form of tone-color, and\
as furnishing a part of the melody of verse. The third function, by\
which individual verses are bound into stanzas, is, in a sense, the most\
important.\
\
On the subject of the \'e6sthetic values of rime, see the chapter on\
"poetic unities" in Corson's _Primer of English Verse_, and Ehrenfeld's\
_Studien zur Theorie des Reims_ (Z\'fcrich, 1897). The problem of the\
relative values of rimed and unrimed verse will come up in connection\
with the history of the heroic couplet and of blank verse. The objection\
always urged against rime is that its demands are likely to turn the\
poet aside from the normal order of his ideas. Herder, as Ehrenfeld\
points out, thought that this was particularly true of English verse,\
the uninflected language not providing so naturally for cases where\
thought and sound are parallel. A recent protest against the tyranny of\
rime is found in the article by Mr. Larminie, cited on page 115, where\
it is claimed that undue attention to form is thinning out the substance\
of modern poetry, and that the demands of rime should be relaxed. See\
also Ben Jonson's "Fit of Rhyme against Rhyme," for a humorous complaint\
against the requirements of rime upon the poet.\
\
     The origin of rime has been a subject of prolonged controversy. See\
     the monograph by Ehrenfeld already cited; Meyer's _Anfang und\
     Ursprung der rythmischen Dichtung_ (Munich, 1884); W. Grimm's\
     _Geschichte des Reims_ (1851); Norden's _Antike Kunstprosa_\
     (Leipzig, 1898; _Anhang ueber die Geschichte des Reims_); Kluge's\
     article, _Zur Geschichte des Reimes im Altgermanischen_, in Paul u.\
     Braune's _Beitr\'e4ge_, vol. ix. p. 422; and Schipper, vol. i. pp. 34\
     ff. Meyer's work is an exposition of the theory that rime was an\
     importation from the Orient. In like manner, it has been held by\
     many that the poetry of Otfried (the first regularly rimed German\
     verse) was produced under Latin influence wholly, and that rime was\
     introduced by him to the Germans (see the work by Kawczynski, cited\
     p. 117). Herder (see Ehrenfeld's monograph) regarded rime as a\
     natural growth of the instinct for symmetry in all human taste,\
     closely connected with dance-rhythms, all forms of parallelism, and\
     the like. Similarity of inflectional endings in similar clauses, he\
     pointed out, would naturally develop rime in any inflected\
     language. This view is in line with the tendency of recent opinion.\
     Schipper says, in effect: "Is rime to be regarded as the invention\
     of a special people, like the Arabian, or is it a form of art which\
     developed in the poetic language of the Aryan peoples, separately\
     in the several nations? In the opinion of the principal scholars\
     the latter opinion is the correct one. The chief support of this\
     opinion is the fact that traces of rime, in greater or less number,\
     appear in the oldest poetry of almost all the partially civilized\
     peoples. 'It is,' says C. F. Meyer, 'something inborn, original,\
     universally human, like poetry and music, and no more than these\
     the special invention of a single people or a particular time.' In\
     fact, traces of rime may be noticed in the poetry of the Greeks, in\
     Homer, \'c6schylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, as also in the poetry of\
     the Romans; in a more developed form it appears in the late middle\
     Latin clerical poetry. In the Celtic languages, moreover, rime is\
     the indispensable mark of the poetic form, even in the oldest\
     extant specimens. The Latin poetry just referred to gives\
     interesting evidence that rime is a characteristic sign of popular\
     poetry. While the quantitative system became dominant, with the\
     artistic verse-forms of the Greeks, in the Golden Age of Roman\
     literature, the early Saturnian verses, written in free rhythms,\
     already showed the popular taste for similarity of sound in the\
     form of alliteration; and in the post-classical time, with the fall\
     of the quantitative metres, rime again came to the front in songs\
     intended for the people. The same element was made so essential a\
     characteristic in the organization of verse in the medi\'e6val Latin,\
     that 'carmen rhythmicum' came to signify a rimed poem, and the\
     later Latinists used the word 'rhythmus' precisely in the sense of\
     'rime.'"\
\
     Schipper goes on to inquire whether this medi\'e6val Latin poetry was\
     the means of introducing rime to the Germanic peoples. Wackernagel\
     held it as certain that Otfried learned his rimes from Latin poems;\
     but as Otfried declares that his poetry is intended to take the\
     place of useless popular songs, it seems probable that he was not\
     using an innovation, and that rime was already popular in Old High\
     German. Indeed, it appears sporadically in the _Hildebrandslied_\
     and the _Heliand_. Grimm observes that it is theoretically unlikely\
     that alliteration should have vanished suddenly and rime as\
     suddenly have taken its place. The gradual development of rime from\
     assonance among the Romance peoples suggests the same thing. The\
     early appearance of rime by the side of alliteration is illustrated\
     by C. F. Meyer (_Historische Studien_, Leipzig, 1851) from the\
     Norse _Edda_, from _Beowulf_, C\'e6dmon, etc. In the later Anglo-Saxon\
     period rime was evidently securing a considerable though uncertain\
     hold. The Riming Poem suggests what development rime might have had\
     in English without the incoming of Romance influences. Grimm\
     observes that, while to his mind alliteration was a finer and\
     nobler quality than rime, there was need of a stronger\
     sound-likeness which should hold the attention more firmly by its\
     unchanging place at the end of the line. Schipper remarks, finally,\
     that the fact that the use of rime in connection with alliteration\
     was especially popular in the southern half of England, where the\
     Romance influence was strongest, may suggest why in the more purely\
     Germanic northern half alliteration remained the single support of\
     the poetic form well into the fifteenth century.\
\
     The appendix to the work of Norden, cited above, is a fuller\
     development of ideas frequently suggested by the sporadic\
     appearance of rime in early Greek and Latin literature. Norden\
     gives many examples of this "rhetorical rime," as well as of rime\
     arising naturally from parallelism of sentence structure found in\
     primitive charms, incantations, and the like. In particular he\
     emphasizes the influence of the figure of _hom\'9coteleuton_ as\
     used in the literary prose of the classical languages. His\
     conclusion is as follows: "Rime, then, was potentially as truly\
     present in the Greek and Latin languages, from the earliest times,\
     as in every other language; but in the metrical (quantitative)\
     poetry it had no regular place, and appeared there in general only\
     sporadically and by chance, being used by only a few poets as a\
     rhetorical ornament. It became actual by the transition from the\
     metrical poetry to the rhythmical (that is, the syllable-counting,\
     in which--in the Latin--the chief consideration is still for the\
     word-accent); and this transition was consummated by the aid of the\
     highly poetic prose, already used for centuries, which was\
     constructed according to the laws of rhythm, and in which the\
     rhetorical hom\'9coteleuton had gained an ever-increasing\
     significance. In particular, rime found an entrance through sermons\
     composed in such prose, and delivered in a voice closely\
     approaching that of singing, into the hymn-poetry which was\
     intimately related to such sermons. From the Latin hymn-poetry it\
     was carried into other languages, from the ninth century onward. It\
     is self-evident that in these languages also rime was potentially\
     present before it became actual through the influence of foreign\
     poetry; for in this region also there operates the highest immanent\
     law of every being and every form of development,--that in the\
     whole field of life nothing absolutely new is invented, but merely\
     slumbering germs are awakened to active life." (_Antike\
     Kunstprosa_, vol. ii. pp. 867 ff.)\

\
This puzzlingly early appearance of rime in Anglo-Saxon verse, in\
conjunction with fairly regular alliteration, is of especial\
interest.[12] "It is supposed," says Schipper, "that this new form has\
for its foundation the Scandinavian _Runhenda_, and that this was known\
to the Anglo-Saxons through the Old Norse poet, Egil Skalagrimsson, who\
was living in England in the tenth century, and who stayed twice in\
England at Athelstan's court, writing a poem in Northumbria in the same\
form." He also observes that the attempt to attain something like\
equality of feet and half-lines suggests the Norse models.\

\
Godric, the hermit of Norfolk, lived about 1065-1170. These verses seem\
to give the earliest extant appearance of end-rime in Middle English.\
The Romance words in the hymn indicate the presence of French influence.\

    I hope to get safely out of the turmoil\
    And arrive one day at the land of the Gypsies,\

\
(BROWNING: _The Flight of the Duchess_, xvii.)\
\
These passages illustrate sufficiently the grotesque effects of double\
and triple rime in English verse,--effects of which Byron and Browning\
are the unquestioned masters. Professor Corson observes that the double\
rime is to be regarded as the means of "some special emphasis," whether\
serious or humorous. More commonly the effect is humorous, of course, as\
in _Don Juan_, where the rimes indicate "the lowering of the poetic\
key--the reduction of true poetic seriousness." The rimes in the _Flight\
of the Duchess_ Mr. Edmund Gurney has said sometimes "produce the\
effect of jokes made during the performance of a symphony." The specimen\
which follows illustrates the use of these double and triple rimes for a\
wholly serious purpose. Professor Corson remarks that in this case the\
rime serves "as a most effective foil to the melancholy theme. It is not\
unlike the laughter of frenzied grief." It is interesting to note that\
in the Italian language, where double rimes are almost constant,\
masculine rimes are sometimes used for grotesque effect in the same way\
that English poets use the feminine.\

\
_Internal rime._\
\
Internal rime may be regarded on the one side as only a matter of the\
division of the verse, since if it occurs regularly at the medial\
cesura, it practically breaks the verse into two parts. On the other\
side, if used only sporadically, it is a matter of tone-color. It\
sometimes appears, however, in forms which entitle it to recognition by\
itself. The earliest of these forms is the "Leonine rime," which is said\
to have taken its name from Leoninus of St. Victor, who in the twelfth\
century wrote elegiacs (hexameters and pentameters) in which the\
syllable preceding the cesura regularly rimed with the final syllable.\
Obviously lines of this kind would easily break up into riming\
half-lines. Similarly, in septenary verse internal rime was often used\
together with end-rime, with a resulting resolution into short-line\
stanzas riming either _aabb_ or _abab_.[14] The following specimen from\
a celebrated ballad shows the popular use of a somewhat complex system\
of internal rime.\
\
    Be it right or wrong, these men among on women do complaine,\
    Affirming this, how that it is a labour spent in vaine,\

    Yet yf a newe to them pursue, ther furst trew lover than\
    Laboureth for nought, and from her thought he is a bannisshed man.\

\
Douglas, like his countryman Dunbar, was something of a metrical\
virtuoso, and his use of internal rime in this ballade is one of his\
most remarkable achievements. In the first stanza there are two internal\
rimes in each line, in the second three, and in the third (here quoted)\
four.\

    Lives and yearns not at heart and burns with hope to serve as he worships\

\
(SWINBURNE: _The Armada_, vii.)\
\
Here the third and eighth syllables of each verse rime, giving the\
effect of a separate melody only half heard under that of the main\

after the riming word, as in the "sing" of the last line quoted.\
\

\
\
B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR)\
\
This division includes the use made of the qualities of sound for the\
purpose of adding to the melodiousness of verse, or of expressing in\
some measure the ideas to be conveyed by means of the very sounds\
employed. Sometimes this takes the form of alliteration, differing from\
that of early English verse only in that it follows no regular\
structural laws. On the other hand, it may take the form of\
_onomatop\'9cia_, the figure of speech in which sound and sense are\
closely related,--as in descriptive words like _buzz_, _hiss_, _murmur_,\
_splash_, and the like. The term Tone-color is formed by analogy with\
the German _Klangfarbe_, an expression apparently due to the feeling\
that the sound-qualities of speech have somewhat the same function as\
the various colors in a picture. It is unquestionably true that the\
selection of sounds, whether vowel or consonantal, has much to do with\
the melodious effect of very much poetry. The poet may choose the\
different sound-qualities (so far as the sense permits) just as the\
musician may choose the varying qualities of the different instruments\
in the orchestra or the different stops in the organ.\
\
Strictly speaking, this matter of Tone-color is not a part of verse-form\
in the same sense as matters of rhythm, rime, and the like; for it may\
appear in prose as well as in verse, and is not in any case reducible to\
formal principles or laws. Yet its use in actual verse is so important,\
and it is so closely related to the use of sound-quality in the form of\
rime and alliteration, that it seems well to include it here.[15]\
\
     Dr. Guest treats sounds as having in themselves the suggestion of\
     more or less definite ideas, this suggestiveness being explainable\
     by physical causes. Thus the trembling character of _l_ suggests\
     trepidation, as in "Double, double, toil and trouble." _R_ suggests\
     harsh, grating, or rattling noises; the sibilants are appropriate\
     to the expression of shrieks, screams, and the like; _b_ and _p_,\
     because of the compression of the lips, suggest muscular effort;\
     _st_, from a sudden stopping of the _s_, suggests fear or surprise;\
     _f_ and _h_ also fear, because of their whispering quality. Hollow\
     sounds (_au_, _ow_, _o_, and the like) suggest depth and fulness.\
     Guest quotes in this connection an interesting passage from Bacon's\
     _Natural History_ (ii. 200): "There is found a similitude between\
     the sound that is made by inanimate bodies, or by animate bodies\
     that have no voice articulate, and divers letters of articulate\
     voices; and commonly men have given such names to those sounds as\
     do allude unto the articulate letters; as trembling of hot water\
     hath resemblance unto the letter _l_; quenching of hot metals with\
     the letter _z_; snarling of dogs with the letter _r_; the noise of\
     screech-owls with the letter _sh_; voice of cats with the diphthong\
     _eu_; voice of cuckoos with the diphthong _ou_; sounds of strings\
     with the diphthong _ng_.\
\
A. W. Schlegel went even farther in suggesting a subtle symbolism in\
sounds apart from descriptive qualities. Thus he regarded _a_ as\
suggestive of bright red, and as symbolizing youth, joy, or brightness\
(as in the words _Strahl_, _Klang_, _Glans_); _i_ as suggestive of\
sky-blue, symbolic of intimacy or love; and so with other vowel sounds.\
(See Ehrenfeld's monograph, p. 57.) In general it may be said that it is\
dangerous to attempt to explain the special effects of tone-color in\
verse, except where it is obviously descriptive, the appreciation of\
such effects being a subtle and a more or less individual matter. On\
this subject Mr. Gurney makes some interesting observations, in the\
essays cited above. He believes that the pleasurable effect of the\
sound-qualities in verse can never be dissociated from the sense of the\
words; that the most melodious verse cannot be appreciated if in a\
foreign language, unless read with particular expressiveness; and that\
the pleasure derived from what we roughly call melodious or harmonious\
verses is always due to the mystical combination of the appropriate\
sound with the poetic content.\
\
Dr. Johnson ridiculed the idea of tone-color, as appearing in Pope's\
teaching that the sound should be "an echo to the sense." See his _Life\
of Pope_, and especially the _Idler_ for June 9, 1759, in which he\
describes Minim the critic as reading "all our poets with particular\
attention to this delicacy of versification." Such a critic discovers\
wonders in these lines from _Hudibras_:\
\
    "Honor is like the glossy bubble,\
    Which cost philosophers such trouble;\
    Where, one part crack'd, the whole does fly,\
    And wits are crack'd to find out why."\
\
"In these verses, says Minim, we have two striking accommodations of the\
sound to the sense. It is impossible to utter the first two lines\
emphatically without an act like that which they describe; _bubble_ and\
_trouble_ causing a momentary inflation of the cheeks by the retention\
of the breath, which is afterwards forcibly emitted, as in the practice\
of _blowing bubbles_. But the greatest excellence is in the third line,\
which is _crack'd_ in the middle to express a crack, and then shivers\
into monosyllables."\
\
In an article on "Some Technical Elements of Style in Literature"\
(originally published in the _Contemporary Review_, April, 1885;\
reprinted in the Scribner edition of Stevenson's Works, vol. xxii. p.\
243) Robert Louis Stevenson discussed some of the more subtle effects of\
vowel and consonant color, as appearing in both prose and verse. The\
combination and repetition of the consonants PVF he found to be\
particularly frequent. The pervading sound-elements in the two following\
passages he analyzed by means of the key-letters in the margin:\
\
    "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan                 (KANDL)\
      A stately pleasure-dome decree,         (KDLSR)\
    Where Alph the sacred river ran           (KANDLSR)\
    Through caverns measureless to man,       (KANLSR)\
      Down to a sunless sea."                 (NDLS)\

    Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,\

(MARLOWE: _The Jew of Malta_, I. i.)\
\
    Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;\
    Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;\
    Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,\
    With purple grapes, green figs and mulberries;\
    The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,\
    And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,\
    And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,\
    To have my love to bed and to arise;\
    And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,\
    To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:\
    Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.\

(SHAKSPERE: _Midsummer Night's Dream_, III. i. 167-177.)\
\
    Now entertain conjecture of a time\
    When creeping murmur and the poring dark\
    Fills the wide vessel of the universe.\
    From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,\
    The hum of either army stilly sounds,\
    That the fix'd sentinels almost receive\
    The secret whispers of each other's watch:\
    Fire answers fire; and through their paly flames\
    Each battle sees the other's umber'd face:\
    Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs\
    Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents\
    The armourers, accomplishing the knights,\
    With busy hammers closing rivets up,\
    Give dreadful note of preparation.\
    The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,\
    And the third hour of drowsy morning name.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Henry V._, Chorus to Act IV.)\
\
    Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,\
    With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals\
    Of fish that, with their fins and shining scales,\
    Glide under the green wave in sculls that oft\
    Bank the mid-sea. Part, single or with mate,\
    Graze the sea-weed, their pasture, and through groves\
    Of coral stray, or, sporting with quick glance,\
    Show to the sun their wav'd coats dropt with gold,\
    Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend\
    Moist nutriment, or under rocks their food\
    In jointed armor watch; on smooth the seal\
    And bended dolphins play: part, huge of bulk,\
    Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,\
    Tempest the ocean.  There leviathan,\
    Hugest of living creatures, on the deep\
    Stretch'd like a promontory, sleeps or swims,\
    And seems a moving land, and at his gills\
    Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.\

              Then in the key-hole turns\
    The intricate wards, and every bolt and bar\
    Of massy iron or solid rock with ease\
    Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,\
    With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,\
    The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\
    Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\
    Of Erebus.\

(_Ib._, II. 876-883.)\
\
    Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones\
    Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold;\
    Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,\
    When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones,\
    Forget not: in thy book record their groans\
    Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient fold\
    Slain by the bloody Piemontese, that rolled\
    Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans\
    The vales redoubled to the hills, and they\
    To heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow\
    O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway\
    The triple Tyrant; that from these may grow\
    A hundredfold, who, having learnt thy way,\
    Early may fly the Babylonian woe.\

(MILTON: _Sonnet on the Late Massacre in Piedmont._)\

    And when they list, their lean and flashy songs\
    Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;\
    The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,\
    But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,\
    Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;\
    Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw\
    Daily devours apace, and nothing said.\

      Their jealous pangs and desperation,\
      Fury, frantic indignation,\
      Depth of pains and height of passion,\
          For the fair, disdainful dame.\

    Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,\
    And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;\
    But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,\
    The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar:\
    When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,\
    The line too labors, and the words move slow;\
    Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,\
    Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.\

(POPE: _Essay on Criticism_, ll. 366-373.)\

    Was nought around but images of rest:\
    Sleep-soothing groves, and quiet lawns between;\
    And flowery beds that slumberous influence kest,\
    From poppies breath'd: and beds of pleasant green,\
    Where never yet was creeping creature seen.\
    Meantime unnumber'd glittering streamlets played,\
    And hurled everywhere their waters' sheen;\
    That, as they bickered through the sunny shade,\
    Though restless still themselves, a lulling murmur made.\
\
(THOMSON: _Castle of Indolence_, canto i. st. 3.)\
\
    Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane\
      In some untrodden region of my mind,\
    Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,\
      Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind:\
    Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees\
      Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep;\
    And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,\
      The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep;\
    And in the midst of this wide quietness\
      A rosy sanctuary will I dress\
    With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain,\
      With buds, and bells, and stars without a name,\
    With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign,\
      Who breeding flowers will never breed the same.\

    He could not see the kindly human face,\
    Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard\
    The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,\
    The league-long roller thundering on the reef,\
    The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd\
    And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep\
    Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,\
    As down the shore he ranged, or all day long\
    Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,\
    A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:\
    No sail from day to day, but every day\
    The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts\
    Among the palms and ferns and precipices;\
    The blaze upon the waters to the east;\
    The blaze upon his island overhead;\
    The blaze upon the waters to the west;\
    Then the great stars that globed themselves in heaven,\
    The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again\
    The scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.\

    To find him in the valley; let the wild\
    Lean-headed eagles yelp alone, and leave\
    The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill\
    Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,\
    That like a broken purpose waste in air:\
    So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales\
    Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth\
    Arise to thee; the children call, and I\
    Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,\
    Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;\
    Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,\
    The moan of doves in immemorial elms,\
    And murmurings of innumerable bees.\

    By woman wailing for her demon-lover!\
    And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,\
    As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\
    A mighty fountain momently was forced:\
    Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst\
    Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,\
    Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail;\
    And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever\
    It flung up momently the sacred river.\
    Five miles meandering, with a mazy motion,\
    Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,\
    Then reach'd the caverns measureless to man,\
    And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean.\

\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[11] "Perfect rime" is a term applied to rimes between two words\
identical in form, but different in meaning. It is inadmissible in\
modern English verse, although it was considered entirely proper in\
Middle English times (compare Chaucer's--\
\
"The holy blisful martir for to _seke_, That hem hath holpen, whan that\
they were _seke_."),\
\
and is still common in French verse.\
\
Schipper gives a separate paragraph also to "unaccented rime," where the\
similarity of sound belongs wholly to final, unstressed syllables.\
Generally speaking, this is inadmissible in English verse. Schipper\
quotes from Thomas Moore:\
\
"Down in yon summervale Where the rill flows, Thus said the Nightingale\
To his loved Rose."\
\
It might be said, however, that the final syllables of "summervale" and\
"nightingale" are not wholly unstressed; moreover, they are in the first\
and third verses of the stanza, where rime is not indispensable.\
Unaccented rime is most noticeable in some of the verse of the\
transition period in the sixteenth century, when the syllable-counting\
principle was so emphasized as to admit any license of accent so long as\
the proper number of syllables was observed. Thus, in the verse of Wyatt\
we find such rimes as "dreadeth" and "seeketh," "beginning" and\
"eclipsing," etc. See p. 10, above.\
\
Imperfect rime, occurring where the vowel sounds are only similar, not\
identical, or where the consonants following them are not identical, is\
commonly regarded as an imperfection in verse form. The most common of\
these imperfect rimes are in cases where the spelling would indicate\
perfect rime (hence where, in many cases, the words rimed originally,\
but have separated in the changes of pronunciation), such as _love_ and\
_move_, _broad_ and _load_, and the like. For a defence of these "rimes\
to the eye," and other imperfect rimes, with a study of their use by\
English poets, see articles by Prof. A. G. Newcomer in the _Nation_ for\
January 26 and February 2, 1899.\
\
[12] Rime also appears in a short passage in Cynewulf's _Elene_. Some\
have thought it a later interpolation, but Schipper thinks it indicates\
that Cynewulf was a Northumbrian. Grein believes him to have been the\
author also of the Riming Poem, but, as Rieger points out, the rimes of\
Cynewulf are of a much less systematic character. (On this see W\'fclcker's\
_Grundriss zur Geschichte der Angels\'e4chsischen Literatur_, pp. 216,\
217.)\

PART TWO\

\
\
\
I. FOUR-STRESS VERSE\
\
\
English verse of four stresses is chiefly to be divided into two groups:\
that representing the primitive Germanic tendency to emphasize the\
element of accent rather than the counting of syllables, and that\
produced under foreign influence, showing comparative regularity in the\
number of syllables to the verse. The first group is made up of the\
various descendants of the original "long line," sometimes rimed and\
sometimes unrimed; the second group of forms of the familiar\
octosyllabic couplet. (Of modern verse only iambic measures are included\
here.)\
\
\
A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING\
\
The earliest English verse, like early Germanic verse generally, is\
based on the recurrence of strong accents, and is composed of a long\
line made up of two short lines, or half-lines, which are bound together\
by alliteration. As to the number of accents to be counted in the line,\
there are two theories, the "two-accent" and the "four-accent."\
According to the first, we should count two accents to the half-line,\
and four to the long line; according to the second, we should count four\
to the half-line and eight to the long line. The distinction is not so\
marked, however, as would appear at first thought; for the two-accent\
theorists recognize a considerable number of secondary accents in\
addition to the principal ones, while the four-accent theorists\
recognize half the accents as being commonly weaker than the other half.\
\
     The four-accent theory is that of Lachmann, represented chiefly in\
     more recent scholarship by ten Brink and Kaluza. Lachmann took, as\
     the typical Germanic line, such a verse as this from the\
     _Hildebrandlied_,--\
\
        "Garutun se iro gu\'f0hama:    gurtun sih iro suert ana;"\
\
     but admitted that the Anglo-Saxon line was a departure from the\
     type in the direction of fewer accents. Ten Brink, however, found\
     the full number of accents in the typical Anglo-Saxon line. "It is\
     based upon a measure which belonged to the antiquity of all\
     Germanic races, namely, the line with eight emphatic syllables,\
     divided into equal parts by the cesura." (_English Literature_,\
     trans. Kennedy, vol. i. pp. 21, 22.) The principal representative\
     of the two-accent theory is Sievers, whose conclusions have been\
     pretty generally accepted by English and American scholars. He\
     admits that very many, perhaps most, Anglo-Saxon lines can be read\
     with eight accents, but shows that there is still a large\
     proportion (some eleven hundred in _Beowulf_) which cannot be so\
     read without wrenching the natural reading. On this subject, see\
     Westphal's _Allgemeine Metrik_, Sievers's _Altgermanische Metrik_,\
     Kaluza's _Der Altenglische Vers_, and the articles by Sievers,\
     Luick, and ten Brink in Paul's _Grundriss der Germanische\
     Philologie_.\
\
Aside from the two-part structure of the long line, the number of\
accents, and the alliteration, Anglo-Saxon verse is marked by the usual\
coincidence of the principal accents with long syllables. The unaccented\
parts of the line vary in both the number and length of the syllables.\
In general, each half-line is divided into two feet, or measures; and,\
according to the structure of these feet, the ordinary half-lines of\
Anglo-Saxon verse have been reduced by Sievers to five fundamental\
types.\
\
Type A is represented by such a half-line as "sti\'f0um wordum."\
\
Type B inverts the rhythm of A, as in the half-line "n\uc0\u275 \
wintersc\uc0\u363 r."\
\
Type C is characterized by the juxtaposition of the two accents, as in\
the half-line "and for\'f0 gangan."\
\
Type D commonly has only the accented syllable in the first foot, while\
the second foot is characterized by a sort of dactylic rhythm, as in the\
half-lines "s\uc0\u483 l\u299 \'f0ende" and "flet innanweard."\
\
Type E inverts the rhythm of D, as in the half-line "gylp-wordum\
spr\'e6c."[16]\
\
In all the types many variations are found. The beginning of the line\
may show anacrusis, and two short syllables may take the place of a long\
syllable; while an indeterminate number of light syllables may often be\
introduced before or after the principal accents.\
\

    \'fe\'e6t w\uc0\u275  m\u333 tun h\u275 r    _merueri_\
    g\uc0\u333 dd\u483 dum begietan      _gaudia in celo_,\
    \'fe\uc0\u483 r w\u275  m\u333 tun        _maxima regna_\

    \uc0\u275 adge mid englum          _Alleluia_.\
\
(From the Anglo-Saxon _Ph\'9cnix_. ab. 700 A.D.)\
\
These closing lines of the poem furnish an important opportunity to\
compare the Latin half-lines with those in Anglo-Saxon. Each half seems\
to be influenced by the metrical nature of the other; the Anglo-Saxon\
being a little more regular in the number of syllables than usual, the\
Latin less regular. Since, to the ear of the writer, the two halves of\
each verse were doubtless fairly equivalent, metrically, and since each\
of the Latin half-lines appears to have two accents, these combination\
verses have been thought to be an argument for the "two-accent" theory\
of Anglo-Saxon verse. On the other hand, the advocates of the\
four-accent theory would read the Latin half-lines with four stresses\
each, on the ground that nearly every syllable was stressed in the\
chanting of such religious verse (_l\'fa-c\'eds a\'fac-t\'f3r_, etc.).\
\
See also the specimens on pp. 13 and 14, above.\

\
(_King Horn_, ll. 1-12. ab. 1200-1250.)\
\
The metre of _King Horn_ is very irregular, and has proved somewhat\
puzzling to scholars. It seems to be the direct result of the primitive\
"long line" broken into two halves by internal rime. The number of\
accents varies greatly: we may have verses which are easily read with\
two, such as--\
\
    "Into schupes borde\
    At the furst worde."\
\
Yet these it is evident might also be read with three accents, as in the\
following couplet also:\
\
    "The se bigan to flowe,\
    And Horn child to rowe."\
\
According as one reads the Anglo-Saxon verse with two or four accents to\
the half-line, he will regard the typical half-line of _King Horn_ as\
made up of two or four accents. If the fundamental number was two, the\
additional accented syllables were doubtless introduced under the\
influence of the French eight-syllable couplet. It is not difficult to\
see how the more regular (Latin or French) and the less regular (native)\
measures might have been confused, and soon have coalesced in popular\
use. Ten Brink, reading the _King Horn_ lines with four accents, speaks\
of them as "formed entirely on the Teutonic principle, with two accents\
upon the sonorous close of the verse, so that it appears to be an\
organic continuation of the chief form in Layamon and in \'c6lfred's\
_Proverbs_. This circumstance makes the poem exceptional among the early\
English romances." He also speaks of "an unmistakably strophic\
construction in the text as we have it." (_English Literature_, Kennedy\
translation, vol. i. p. 227.)\

(_Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight_, strophe xviii. ab. 1375.)\
\
These two specimens, both doubtless the work of the same author (to whom\
are also attributed the _Pearl_ and _Cleanness_), represent the\
patriotic revival of the alliterative long line by contemporaries of\
Chaucer in the latter half of the fourteenth century. In _Sir Gawayne_\
the rimeless long line is gathered into strophes, each of which\
concludes with four riming lines. (See above, p. 109.)\
\
     For analysis of this revived alliterative verse, see a valuable\
     article by Dr. Luick, _Die Englische Stabreimzeile im 14n, 15n, und\
     16n Jahrhundert_, in _Anglia_, vol. xi. pp. 392 and 553. Luick\
     analyzes not only the poems of the "Pearl poet," but also the _Troy\
     Book_, the _Alexander Fragments_, _William of Palerne_, _Joseph of\
     Arimathea_, _Morte Arthure_, and minor poems. He finds the _Troy\
     Book_ the most regular alliterative poem of Middle English, but in\
     all of the group a general tendency to preserve not only the early\
     laws of alliteration but also the "five types" of Sievers's\
     Anglo-Saxon metrics. Dr. Luick attributes the final decline of the\
     old measure in large degree to the falling away of the final\
     syllables in _-e_, etc.; without these numerous feminine endings\
     the primitive "long line" was impossible. This he regards as\
     regrettable, since the old alliterative verse, "growing up on\
     native soil with the language itself," represented the natural\
     accent-relations of the Germanic languages, especially the\
     recognition of two principal degrees of accent; whereas the modern\
     rimed verse requires the reduction of this to a uniform "tick-tack"\
     of alternating stress and non-stress.\
\
    He put on his back a good plate-jack,\
      And on his head a cap of steel,\
    With sword and buckler by his side;\
      O gin he did not become them weel!\
\
(_Ballad of Bewick and Grahame_. In GUMMERE'S _English Ballads_, p.\
176.)\
\
The regular stanza of the old ballads was of this four-stress type, with\
extra light syllables admitted anywhere yet not in great numbers. More\
commonly, however, the fourth stress was lost from the second and fourth\
lines. (See p. 264, below.)\
\
    I thanke hym full thraly, and sir, I saie hym the same,\
    But what marvelous materes dyd this myron ther mell?\

\
(_Gammer Gurton's Needle_, Prologue. 1566.)\
\
In these specimens we have the later descendant of the long line as used\
in the early drama of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,--the\
"tumbling verse," regular in rhythm and rime, but indifferent to the\
number of syllables.[17] Sometimes, where most regular, as in lines 2-4\
of the second specimen, the measure approximates closely to regular\
four-stress anapestic.\
\
    The time was once, and may againe retorne,\
    (For ought may happen that hath bene beforne),\
    When shepheards had none inheritaunce,\
    Ne of land, nor fee in sufferaunce,\
    But what might arise of the bare sheepe,\
    (Were it more or lesse) which they did keepe.\
    Well ywis was it with shepheards thoe:\
    Nought having, nought feared they to forgoe;\
    For Pan himselfe was their inheritaunce,\
    And little them served for their mayntenaunce.\
    The shepheards God so wel them guided,\
    That of nought they were unprovided;\
    Butter enough, honye, milke, and whay,\
    And their flockes' fleeces them to araye.\
\
(SPENSER: _The Shepherd's Calendar, May._ 1579.)\
\
Spenser's use of the tumbling verse in the _Shepherd's Calendar_ was a\
part of his imitation of older forms for the sake of an uncultivated,\
bucolic effect. In his hands the irregular measure showed a tendency to\
reduce itself to regular ten-syllable lines, like the first two of the\
present specimen, which, by themselves, might easily be read as\
decasyllabic iambics. On this, see further under Five-Stress Verse.\
Spenser was perhaps the last cultivated poet to use the irregular\
measure, until we come to modern imitators of the early popular poetry.\
The following specimen is of this class.\
\
    It was up in the morn we rose betimes\
    From the hall-floor hard by the row of limes.\
    It was but John the Red and I,\
    And we were the brethren of Gregory;\
    And Gregory the Wright was one\
    Of the valiant men beneath the sun,\
    And what he bade us that we did,\
    For ne'er he kept his counsel hid.\
    So out we went, and the clattering latch\
    Woke up the swallows under the thatch.\
    It was dark in the porch, but our scythes we felt,\
    And thrust the whetstone under the belt.\
    Through the cold garden boughs we went\
    Where the tumbling roses shed their scent.\
    Then out a-gates and away we strode\
    O'er the dewy straws on the dusty road,\
    And there was the mead by the town-reeve's close\
    Where the hedge was sweet with the wilding rose.\

\
B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET)\
\
The more regular four-stress verse, in rimed couplets showing a tendency\
to be octosyllabic, we have seen to be generally attributed to the\
influence of the French octosyllabics, which were in common use in late\
medi\'e6val French poetry, such as that of Wace and Chrestien de Troyes.\
\
     According to Stengel (in Gr\'f6ber's _Grundriss der Romanischen\
     Philologie_), this octosyllabic French verse goes back to a lost\
     vulgar Latin verse; this view is opposed by Dr. C. M. Lewis, in his\
     _Foreign Sources of Modern English Versification_ (Yale Studies in\
     English, 1898), who finds its origin in the tetrameter of the Latin\
     hymns. Dr. Lewis also attributes to this Latin verse more direct\
     influence on English verse than is commonly assumed. Thus he finds\
     in it, rather than in the French octosyllabics, the model of the\
     verse of the _Pater Noster_, quoted below. The argument is briefly\
     this: the Latin verse was both accentual and syllabic; the French\
     verse was syllabic but not accentual; that of the _Pater Noster_ is\
     accentual but not syllabic; hence it is more nearly like the Latin\
     than the French. A stanza of the Latin tetrameter, cited by Dr.\
     Lewis from the hymn _Aurora lucis rutilat_, is as follows:\
\
        "Tristes erat apostoli\
        de nece sui Domini,\
        quem p\'9cna mortis crudeli\
        servi damnarunt impii."\
\
     Compare these lines from the _Brut_ of Wace:\
\
        "Adunt apela Cordeille\
        qui esteit sa plus joes ne fille;\
        pur ce que il l'aveit plus chiere\
        que Raga\'fc ne la premiere\
        quida que el e cune\'fcst\
        que plus chier des al tres l'e\'fcst.\
        Cordeil le out bien escut\'e9\
        et bien out en sun cuer not\'e9\
        cument ses deus sorurs parlo\'ebnt,\
        cument lur pere losengo\'ebnt."\
\
     The last four verses of this passage are cited by Schipper as\
     illustrating the regular iambic character of the French\
     octosyllabics; but Dr. Lewis regards the measure as purely\
     syllabic, with no regard for alternation of accents, and instances\
     the earlier lines of the passage as being quite as nearly anapestic\
     as iambic. (See Schipper, vol. i. p. 107, and Lewis's monograph, as\
     cited above, pp. 73 ff. See also Crow: _Zur Geschichte des Kurzen\
     Reimpaares in Mittel Englisch._) Dr. Lewis's conclusion is: "We may\
     therefore sum up the whole history of our octosyllabic verse in\
     this way: we borrowed its number of accents from the Latin, but\
     owing to the vitality of our own native traditions we at first\
     borrowed nothing further; the syllabic character of the verse (so\
     far as it has been imported at all), came in only gradually,\
     against stubborn resistance; and it came not directly from the\
     Latin, but indirectly, through the French" (pp. 97, 98). Some of\
     these statements are open to question; but however we may interpret\
     the French verse of Wace and his contemporaries, it is obvious that\
     in English the influence of the Latin and the French poetry would\
     very naturally be fused, with no necessarily clear conception of\
     definite verse-structure. Whether under French or Latin influence,\
     however, the new tendency was for the more accurate counting of\
     syllables. We may see some suggestion of this in the verses of St.\
     Godric, quoted on p. 126, above, although they are not regularly\
     iambic. The poem on the "Eleven Pains of Hell" (in the _Old English\
     Miscellany_) shows the French influence clearly marked by the\
     language of its opening verses:\
\
        "Ici comencent les unze peynes\
        De enfern, les queus seynt pool v[ist]."\
\
    Ure feder \'feet in heovene is,\
    \'deet is al so\'fe ful iwis!\
    Weo moten to theor weordes iseon,\
    \'deet to live and to saule gode beon,\
    \'deet weo beon swa his sunes iborene,\
    \'deet he beo feder and we him icorene,\
    \'deet we don alle his ibeden\
    And his wille for to reden.\
\
(_The Pater Noster_, ab. 1175. In Morris's _Old English Homilies_, p.\
55.)\
\
This poem is sometimes said to show the first appearance of the\
octosyllabic couplet in English. It suggests the struggle between native\
indifference to syllable-counting and imitation of the greater\
regularity of its models. As Dr. Morris says of the next specimen: "The\
essence of the system of versification which the poet has adopted is,\
briefly, that every line shall have four accented syllables in it, the\
unaccented syllables being left in some measure, as it were, to take\
care of themselves." But this does not altogether do justice to the new\
regularity. Schipper says that of the first 100 lines of the poem 20 are\
perfectly regular. (See his notes in vol. i. p. 109.) In the following\
specimens we may trace the gradual growth of skill and accuracy.\

\
(_Lay of Havelok the Dane._ ll. 1-16. ab. 1300.)\
\
For lays and romances, both French and English, the four-stress couplet\
was an easy and favorite form. Compare the remarks of ten Brink: "We see\
how the short couplet, which is the standing form of the court-romance,\
was not only transmitted to it from the legendary, didactic, and\
historical poems, but was also suggested to it by those songs to which\
it was indebted for its own subject-matter. Other tokens indicate that a\
short strophe composed of eight-syllabled lines, with single or\
alternating rhymes, was a favorite form for many subjects in this\
_jongleur_ poetry.... The simple form of the short couplet offered to\
the romance-poet no scope to compete in metrical technique with the\
skilled court-lyrists. He could prove his art only within a limited\
portion of this field: in the treatment of the _enjambement_ and\
particularly of rhyme. The poet strove not only to form pure rhymes, but\
often to carry them forward with more syllables than were essential, and\
he was fond of all sorts of grammatical devices in rhyme." (_English\
Literature_, Kennedy trans., vol. i. pp. 174, 175.)\

\
(CHAUCER: _House of Fame_, ll. 1091-1108. ab. 1385.)\
\
It was Gower and Chaucer, in the fourteenth century, who brought the use\
of the eight-syllable couplet to the point of accuracy and perfection.\
Gower made it the vehicle of the interminable narrative of the\
_Confessio Amantis_, using it with regularity but with great monotony.\
Chaucer transformed it into a much more flexible form (with freedom of\
cesura, _enjambement_, and inversions), using it in about 3500 lines of\
his poetry (excluding the translation of the _Roman de la Rose_), but\
early leaving it for the decasyllabic verse. In modern English poetry\
this short couplet has rarely been used for continuous narrative of a\
serious character, except by Byron and Wordsworth.\
\
    But let my due feet never fail\

    There let the pealing organ blow,\
    To the full-voiced choir below,\

    As may with sweetness, through mine ear,\
    Dissolve me into ecstasies,\
    And bring all heaven before my eyes.\

    That with more care keep holyday\

\
(SAMUEL BUTLER: _Hudibras_, Part I. 1663.)\
\
Butler made the octosyllabic couplet so entirely his own, for the\
purposes of his jogging satiric verse, that ever since it has frequently\
been called "Hudibrastic." The ingenuity of his rimes added not a little\
to its effectiveness. In the _Spectator_ (No. 249) Addison said that\
burlesque poetry runs best "in doggrel like that of _Hudibras_, ... when\
a hero is to be pulled down and degraded;" otherwise in the heroic\
measure. He speaks also of "the generality" of Butler's readers as being\
"wonderfully pleased with the double rhymes."\
\
    How deep yon azure dyes the sky,\

    The lake is smooth and clear beneath,\
    Where once again the spangled show\
    Descends to meet our eyes below.\
    The grounds which on the right aspire,\
    In dimness from the view retire:\
    The left presents a place of graves,\
    Whose wall the silent water laves.\
    That steeple guides thy doubtful sight\
    Among the livid gleams of night.\
    There pass, with melancholy state,\
    By all the solemn heaps of fate,\
    And think, as softly-sad you tread\
    Above the venerable dead,\
    'Time was, like thee they life possest,\
    And time shalt be, that thou shalt rest.'\
\
(THOMAS PARNELL: _A Night-Piece on Death_, ab. 1715.)\
\
Mr. Gosse speaks of Parnell's employment of the octosyllabic couplet in\
this poem as "wonderfully subtle and harmonious." (_Eighteenth Century\
Literature_, p. 137.)\
\
    A Hare who, in a civil way,\
    Complied with everything, like Gay,\
    Was known by all the bestial train\
    Who haunt the wood, or graze the plain.\
    Her care was never to offend,\
    And every creature was her friend.\
    As forth she went at early dawn,\
    To taste the dew-besprinkled lawn,\
    Behind she hears the hunter's cries,\
    And from the deep-mouthed thunder flies:\
    She starts, she stops, she pants for breath;\
    She hears the near advance of death;\
    She doubles, to mislead the hound,\
    And measures back her mazy round:\
    Till, fainting in the public way,\
    Half dead with fear she gasping lay.\
\
(JOHN GAY: _The Hare and Many Friends_, in _Fables_. 1727.)\
\
Gay's use of the short couplet in his _Fables_ sometimes shows it at its\
best for narrative purposes.\
\
    My female friends, whose tender hearts\
    Have better learned to act their parts,\
    Receive the news in doleful dumps:\
    'The Dean is dead: (Pray what is trumps?)\
    Then, Lord have mercy on his soul!\
    (Ladies, I'll venture for the vole.)\
    Six Deans, they say, must bear the pall:\
    (I wish I knew what king to call).\
    Madam, your husband will attend\
    The funeral of so good a friend?\
    No, madam, 'tis a shocking sight:\
    And he's engaged to-morrow night:\
    My Lady Club will take it ill,\
    If he should fail her at quadrille.\
    He loved the Dean--(I lead a heart)\
    But dearest friends, they say, must part.\
    His time was come: he ran his race;\
    We hope he's in a better place.'\
\
(SWIFT: _On the Death of Dr. Swift._ 1731.)\
\
Swift made use of the octosyllabic couplet in nearly all his verse, and\
with no little vigor and originality. Mr. Gosse remarks: "His lines fall\
like well-directed blows of the flail, and he gives the octosyllabic\
measure, which he is accustomed to choose on account of the Hudibrastic\
opportunities it offers, a character which is entirely his own."\
(_Eighteenth Century Literature_, p. 153.)\

    Her let our sires and matrons hoar\
    Welcome to Britain's ravaged shore;\
    Our youths, enamored of the fair,\
    Play with the tangles of her hair,\
    Till, in one loud applauding sound,\
    The nations shout to her around,--\
    O how supremely thou art blest,\
    Thou, lady, thou shalt rule the West!\
\
(COLLINS: _Ode to Liberty._ 1746.)\
\
    When chapman billies leave the street,\
    And drouthy neibors, neibors meet;\
    As market days are wearing late,\
    And folk begin to tak the gate,\
    While we sit bousing at the nappy,\
    An' getting fou and unco happy,\
    We think na on the lang Scots miles,\
    The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles,\
    That lie between us and our hame,\
    Where sits our sulky, sullen dame,\
    Gathering her brows like gathering storm,\
    Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.\
\
(BURNS: _Tam O'Shanter_, ll. 1-12. 1790.)\
\
    They chain'd us each to a column stone,\
    And we were three--yet, each alone;\
    We could not move a single pace,\
    We could not see each other's face,\
    But with that pale and livid light\
    That made us strangers in our sight:\
    And thus together--yet apart,\
    Fetter'd in hand, but joined in heart,\
    'Twas still some solace, in the dearth\
    Of the pure elements of earth,\
    To hearken to each other's speech,\
    And each turn comforter to each,\
    With some new hope, or legend old,\
    Or song heroically bold.\
\
(BYRON: _The Prisoner of Chillon_, iii. 1816.)\
\
    A mortal song we sing, by dower\
    Encouraged of celestial power;\
    Power which the viewless Spirit shed\
    By whom we first were visited;\
    Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wings\
    Swept like a breeze the conscious strings,\
    When, left in solitude, erewhile\
    We stood before this ruined Pile,\
    And, quitting unsubstantial dreams,\
    Sang in this Presence kindred themes.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _White Doe of Rylstone_, canto vii. ll. 282-291. 1815.)\
\
    Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,\
    That on the field his targe he threw,\
    Whose brazen studs and tough bull-hide\
    Had death so often dash'd aside;\
    For, train'd abroad his arms to wield,\
    Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield....\
    Three times in closing strife they stood,\
    And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;\
    No stinted draught, no scanty tide,\
    The gushing flood the tartans dyed.\
    Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,\
    And shower'd his blows like wintry rain;\
    And, as firm rock, or castle-roof,\
    Against the winter shower is proof,\
    The foe, invulnerable still,\
    Foil'd his wild rage by steady skill;\
    Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand\
    Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,\
    And backward borne upon the lea,\
    Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee.\
\
(SCOTT: _The Lady of the Lake_, canto v. st. xv. 1810.)\
\
    How this their joy fulfilled might move\
    The world around I know not well;\
    But yet this idle dream doth tell\
    That no more silent was the place,\
    That new joy lit up every face,\
    That joyous lovers kissed and clung,\
    E'en as these twain, that songs were sung\
    From mouth to mouth in rose-bowers,\
    Where hand in hand and crowned with flowers,\
    Folk praised the Lover and Beloved\
    That such long years, such pain had proved;\
    But soft, they say, their joyance was\
    When midst them soon the twain did pass,\
    Hand locked in hand, heart kissing heart,\
    No more this side of death to part--\
    No more, no more--full soft I say\
    Their greetings were that happy day,\
    As though in pensive semblance clad;\
    For fear their faces over-glad\
    This certain thing should seem to hide,\
    That love can ne'er be satisfied.\

II. FIVE-STRESS VERSE\
\
\
The five-stress or decasyllabic verse (iambic pentameter) is so much\
more widely used in modern English poetry than any other verse-form,\
that its history is of special interest. It is curious that a form so\
completely adopted as the favorite of English verse should be borrowed\
rather than native; but, the syllable-counting principle once being\
admitted, there is nothing in five-stress verse inconsistent with native\
English tendencies. A very great part of such verse has really only four\
full accents, and this we have seen to be the number of accents in the\
native English verse. On this point, see further remarks in connection\
with the specimen from Spenser, p. 180 below.\
\
This verse appears in two great divisions, rimed (the decasyllabic\
couplet) and unrimed (blank verse). The rimed form was the earlier, the\
unrimed being merely a modification of it under the influence of other\
unrimed metres.\

\
This early religious lyric is of interest as containing the first known\
use of the five-stress couplet in English. Here it is only in a few\
lines that the couplet occurs, and so sporadic an occurrence should\
perhaps be regarded as due to nothing more than chance. See Schipper,\
vol. i. p. 439, and ten Brink's _Chaucer's Sprache und Verskunst_, p.\
173 f. Ten Brink calls attention to another fairly regular five-stress\
verse, found on p. 253 of Wright's _Political Songs_:\
\
    "For miht is riht, the loud is laweless."[19]\
\
    And, as for me, though that my wit be lyte,\
    On bokes for to rede I me delyte,\
    And in myn herte have hem in reverence;\
    And to hem yeve swich lust and swich credence,\
    That ther is wel unethe game noon\
    That from my bokes make me too goon,\
    But hit be other up-on the haly-day,\
    Or elles in the joly tyme of May;\
    Whan that I here the smale foules singe,\
    And that the floures ginne for to springe,\
    Farwel my studie, as lasting that sesoun!\
    Now have I therto this condicioun\
    That, of alle the floures in the mede,\
    Than love I most these floures whyte and rede,\
    Swiche as men callen daysies in our toun.\
    To them have I so greet affeccioun.\
\
(CHAUCER: _Legend of Good Women_, Prologue, ll. 29-44. Text A. ab.\
1385.)\
\
    A good man was ther of religioun,\
    And was a povre Persoun of a toun;\
    But riche he was of holy thoght and werk.\
    He was also a lerned man, a clerk,\
    That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;\
    His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.\
    Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,\
    And in adversitee ful pacient;...\
    He wayted after no pompe and reverence,\
    Ne maked him a spyced conscience,\
    But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve,\
    He taughte, and first he folwed it himselve.\
\
(CHAUCER: Prologue to _Canterbury Tales_, ll. 477-484, 525-528. ab.\
1385.)\
\
With Chaucer we have the first deliberate use of the five-stress\
couplet, in continuous verse, known to English poetry. His earliest use\
of the pentameter line was in the _Compleynt to Pitee_ (perhaps written\
about 1371), in the "rime royal" stanza; his earliest use of the\
pentameter couplet was in the _Legend of Good Women_, usually dated\
1385. From that time the measure became almost his only instrument, and\
we find altogether in his poetry some 16,000 lines in the couplet,\
besides some 14,000 more in rime royal. Too much praise cannot be given\
Chaucer's use of the couplet. Although it was an experiment in English\
verse, it has perhaps hardly been used since his time with greater\
skill. He used a variety of cesuras (see ten Brink's monograph for the\
enumeration of them), a very large number of feminine endings (such as\
the still pronounced final-_e_ and similar syllables easily provided),\
free inversions in the first foot and elsewhere, and many run-on lines\
(in a typical 100 lines some 16 run-on lines and 7 run-on couplets\
appearing). The total effect is one of combined freedom and mastery, of\
fluent conversational style yet within the limits of guarded artistic\
form. "Much more regularly than the French and Proven\'e7als, and yet\
without pedantic stiffness, he made his verse advance with a sort of\
iambic gait, and he was therefore able to give up and exchange for a\
freer arrangement the immovable cesura, which these poets had always\
made to coincide with a foot-ending." (Ten Brink, in _English\
Literature_, Kennedy trans., vol. ii. p. 48.) On Chaucer's verse, see,\
besides the monograph of ten Brink already cited, Lounsbury's _Studies\
in Chaucer_, vol. iii. pp. 297 ff., and Schipper, vol. i. pp. 442 ff.\
\
    The common assumption is, that Chaucer borrowed the pentameter\
    couplet directly from French poetry. On the history of this in\
    France, see Stengel, in Gr\'f6ber's _Grundriss der Romanischen\
    Philologie_.[20] The decasyllabic verse was fairly common in France\
    in the fourteenth century (being called "_vers commun_" according to\
    Stengel); but in the form of the couplet it was not. Professor\
    Skeat says: "To say that it [Chaucer's couplet] was derived from the\
    French ten-syllable verse is not a complete solution of the mystery;\
    for nearly all such verse is commonly either in stanzas, or else a\
    great number of successive lines are rimed together; and these, I\
    believe, are rather scarce. After some search I have, however,\
    fortunately lighted upon a very interesting specimen, among the\
    poems of Guillaume de Machault, a French writer whom Chaucer is\
    known to have imitated, and who died in 1377. In the edition of\
    Machault's poems edited by Tarb\'e9, Reims and Paris, 1849, p. 89,\
    there is a poem of exactly this character, of no great length, but\
    fortunately dated; for its title is 'Complainte \'e9crite apr\'e8s la\
    bataille de Poitiers et avant le si\'e8ge de Reims par les Anglais'\
    (1356-1358). The first four lines run thus:\
\
        "'A toy, Henry, dous amis, me complain,\
        Pour ce que ne cueur ne mont ne plein;\
        Car a piet suy, sans cheval et sans selle,\
        Et si n'ay mais esmeraude, ne belle.'\
\
     ... Now as Chaucer was taken prisoner in France in 1359, he had an\
     excellent opportunity for making himself acquainted with this poem,\
     and with others, possibly, in a similar metre, which have not come\
     down to us." (_The Prioress's Tale_, Introduction, pp. xix, xx.)\
     Paris has shown that the real date of the poem in question was\
     1340; the title quoted by Skeat is Tarb\'e9's modern French caption.\
     Professor Kittredge has called my attention to the fact that there\
     is another poem of Machault's in the same metre (P. Paris's edition\
     of _Voir-Dit_, p. 56), and also a poem by Froissart, the "Orloge\
     Amoureus."\
\
     Ten Brink calls attention to the possibility of the influence upon\
     Chaucer's couplet of the Italian hendecasyllabic verse. The\
     _Compleynte to Pitee_, it is true, was written probably before the\
     Italian journey of 1372-1373; but in Italy the "full significance"\
     of the metre may have become clear to Chaucer. "After that journey\
     the heroic verse appears almost exclusively as his poetic\
     instrument.... Of still greater significance is the fact that\
     Chaucer's heroic verse differs from the French decasyllabic in all\
     the particulars in which the Italian hendecasyllabic departs from\
     the common source, and approaches the verse of Dante and Boccaccio\
     as closely as the metre of a Germanic language can approach a\
     Romance metre. It may be added also that the heroic verse in the\
     _Compleynte to Pitee_ stands nearer the French decasyllabic than\
     that of the _Troilus_ or the _Canterbury Tales_."\
\
     Dr. Lewis, on the other hand, in _The Foreign Sources of English\
     Versification_, would minimize the foreign sources of Chaucer's\
     couplet. Not only the unaccentual character of the French verse is\
     opposed to the theory of the French source, but also, he believes,\
     the fixed cesura. "In the English verse there is no such thing:\
     indeed there is no cesura at all, in the French sense of the\
     word.... Schipper relegates to a foot-note the suggestion that our\
     heroic verse may have originated in a different way, either through\
     an abridgment of the alexandrine or through an extension of the\
     four-foot line. This is of course more nearly the true view, but it\
     is entirely immaterial which of the last two explanations we hit\
     upon. Accentual verses of four, six, and seven feet were already\
     familiar long before Chaucer's time. They exhibited a more or less\
     regular alternation of arsis and thesis. To devise a verse which\
     should be essentially the same in principle, but should have five\
     accents instead of four, six, or seven, was a task that Chaucer's\
     genius might well achieve unaided" (pp. 98, 99).\
\
     It is quite possible that a combination of all these views may be\
     nearest the truth. The objection to the French influence on the\
     ground of the syllabic (non-accentual) quality of the French verse\
     does not seem to be serious, since any imitation of French verse by\
     an Englishman would be likely to take on the accentual form; and,\
     that once done, the need for the fixed cesura would vanish. But it\
     is worth while to emphasize the fact that the genius of English\
     verse was not so averse to the formation of a decasyllabic\
     five-stress line as to make it a serious innovation. This view is\
     further emphasized by the next specimen.\
\
    Is not thilke the mery moneth of May,\
    When love-lads masken in fresh aray?\
    How falles it, then, we no merrier bene,\
    Ylike as others, girt in gawdy greene?\
    Our bloncket liveryes bene all to sadde\
    For thilke same season, when all is ycladd\
    With pleasaunce: the grownd with grasse, the Woods\
    With greene leaves, the bushes with bloosming buds.\
    ... Tho to the greene Wood they speeden hem all,\
    To fetchen home May with their musicall:\
    And home they bringen in a royall throne,\
    Crowned as king: and his Queene attone\
    Was Lady Flora, on whom did attend\
    A fayre flocke of Faeries, and a fresh bend\
    Of lovely Nymphs. (O that I were there,\
    To helpen the Ladyes their Maybush beare!)\
    Ah! Piers, bene not thy teeth on edge, to thinke\
\
(SPENSER: _The Shepherd's Calendar, May_. 1579.)\
\
This specimen is properly not in five-stress verse, but in irregular\
four-stress ("tumbling verse"); compare the specimen on p. 158, above.\
We have a close approach, however, to the regular five-stress verse, in\
such lines as the fourth, fifth, eleventh, thirteenth, and seventeenth.\
On this and similar passages in the _Shepherd's Calendar_, as\
illustrating the close relation between the native measure and the newer\
one, see an article by Professor Gummere, in the _American Journal of\
Philology_, vol. vii. pp. 53ff. Other verses cited by Dr. Gummere are:\
\
    "Whose way is wildernesse, whose ynne Penaunce."\
\
    "And dirks the beauty of my blossomes rownd."\
\
    "That oft the blood springeth from woundes wyde."\
\
    "There at the dore he cast me downe hys pack."\
\
It is pointed out that the regular five-stress line, when having--as\
very frequently--only four full stresses (two or three light syllables\
coming together, especially at the pause), can hardly be distinguished\
from certain forms of the native four-stress verse. See also the\
Eclogues for February and August, in the _Shepherd's Calendar_. Dr.\
Gummere's conclusion is, that "practically all the elements of\
Anglo-Saxon verse are preserved in our modern poetry, though in\
different combinations, with changed proportional importance."\
\
    But the false Fox most kindly played his part;\
    For whatsoever mother-wit or art\
    Could work, he put in proof: no practice sly,\
    No counterpoint of cunning policy,\
    No reach, no breach, that might him profit bring,\
    But he the same did to his purpose wring....\
    He fed his cubs with fat of all the soil,\
    And with the sweet of others' sweating toil;\
    He crammed them with crumbs of benefices,\
    And fill'd their mouths with meeds of malefices.\

\
(SPENSER: _Mother Hubbard's Tale_, ll. 1137-1166. 1591.)\
\
Spenser's use of the heroic couplet for the _Mother Hubbard's Tale_ is\
the earliest instance of its adoption in English for satirical verse,--a\
purpose for which its later history showed it to be peculiarly well\
fitted.\
\
    Upon her head she wore a myrtle wreath,\
    From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath:\
    Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\
    Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives:\
    Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,\
    When 'twas the odor which her breath forth cast;\
    And there for honey bees have sought in vain,\
    And, beat from thence, have lighted there again.\
    About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\
    Which, lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\

    Too popular is tragic poesy,\

    And doth beside on rimeless numbers tread;\
    Unbid iambics flow from careless head.\

    Compileth worm-eat stories of old times:\
    And he, like some imperious Maronist,\
    Conjures the Muses that they him assist.\
    Then strives he to bombast his feeble lines\
    With far-fetch'd phrase.-- ...\
    Painters and poets, hold your ancient right:\
    Write what you will, and write not what you might:\

    Could ye forbear some smiles, and taunting mirth?\
\
(JOSEPH HALL: _Virgidemiarum Libri VI._, bk. i. satire 4. 1597.)\
\
Joseph Hall was the most vigorous satirist of the group of Elizabethans\
who, in the last decade of the sixteenth century, were imitating the\
satires of Horace, Juvenal, and Persius. Hall's satires have a curiously\
eighteenth-century flavor, and his couplets are frequently very similar\
to those of the age of Pope. Thus Thomas Warton (in his _History of\
English Poetry_) observed of Hall that "the fabric of the couplets\
approaches to the modern standard;" and Anderson, who edited the\
_British Poets_ in 1795, said: "Many of his lines would do honor to the\
most harmonious of our modern poets. The sense has generally such a\
pause, and will admit of such a punctuation at the close of the second\
line, as if it were calculated for a modern ear." On the verse of these\
Elizabethan satirists in general, see _The Rise of Formal Satire in\
England_, by the present editor (_Publications of the Univ. of Penna_.).\
\
On the other hand, the verse of the satires of John Donne, from which\
the following specimen is taken, is the roughest and most difficult of\
all the satires of the group. The reputation of Donne's satires for\
metrical ruggedness has affected unjustly that of his other poetry and\
that of the Elizabethan satires in general. Dryden said: "Would not\
Donne's Satires, which abound with so much wit, appear more charming if\
he had taken care of his words and of his numbers?" (_Essay on Satire._)\
And Pope "versified" two of them, so as to bring them into a form\
pleasing to the ear of his age.\
\
    Therefore I suffered this: towards me did run\
    A thing more strange than on Nile's slime the sun\
    E'er bred, or all which into Noah's ark came:\
    A thing which would have posed Adam to name;\
    Stranger than seven antiquaries' studies,\
    Than Afric's monsters, Guiana's rarities;...\
    Sleeveless his jerkin was, and it had been\
    Velvet, but 'twas now (so much ground was seen)\
    Become tufftaffaty; and our children shall\
    See it plain rash awhile, then nought at all.\
    This thing hath travelled, and faith, speaks all tongues,\
    And only knoweth what to all states belongs.\
\
(JOHN DONNE: _Satire iv._ ll. 17 ff. ab. 1593.)\
\
    This fellow pecks up wit, as pigeons peas,\
    And utters it again when God doth please.\
    He is wit's pedlar, and retails his wares\
    At wakes, and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;\
    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,\
    Have not the grace to grace it with such show.\
    This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve.\
    Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve.\
    He can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he\
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;\
    This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,\
    That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice\
    In honorable terms: nay, he can sing\
    A mean most meanly, and, in ushering,\
    Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;\
    The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet.\

The use of rimed couplets in Shakspere's dramas is especially\
characteristic of his earlier work. In this play, _Love's Labor's Lost_,\
Dowden says, "there are about two rhymed lines to every one of blank\
verse" (_Shakspere Primer_, p. 44). In the late plays, on the other\
hand, rime disappears almost altogether. It will be observed that while\
Shakspere's heroic verse is usually fairly regular, with not very many\
run-on lines, it yet differs in quality from that of satires. The\
dramatic use moulds it into different cadences, and the single couplet\
is, perhaps, less noticeably the unit of the verse.\
\
    Shepherd, I pray thee stay. Where hast thou been?\
    Or whither goest thou? Here be woods as green\
    As any; air likewise as fresh and sweet\
    As where smooth Zephyrus plays on the fleet\
    Face of the curled streams; with flowers as many\
    As the young spring gives, and as choice as any;\
    Here be all new delights, cool streams and wells,\
    Arbors o'ergrown with woodbines, caves, and dells;\
    Choose where thou wilt, whilst I sit by and sing,\
    Or gather rushes, to make many a ring\
    For thy long fingers; tell thee tales of love,--\
    How the pale Phoebe, hunting in a grove,\
    First saw the boy Endymion, from whose eyes\
    She took eternal fire that never dies;\
    How she conveyed him softly in a sleep,\
    His temples bound with poppy, to the steep\
    Head of old Latmus, where she stoops each night,\
    Gilding the mountain with her brother's light,\
    To kiss her sweetest.\
\
(FLETCHER: _The Faithful Shepherdess_, I. iii. ab. 1610.)\
\
Fletcher uses the couplet in this drama with a freedom hardly found\
elsewhere until the time of Keats; see the remark of Symonds, quoted p.\
210, below.\
\
    If Rome so great, and in her wisest age,\
    Fear'd not to boast the glories of her stage,\
    As skilful Roscius, and grave \'c6sop, men,\
    Yet crown'd with honors, as with riches, then;\
    Who had no less a trumpet of their name\
    Than Cicero, whose every breath was fame:\
    How can so great example die in me,\
    That, Allen, I should pause to publish thee?\
    Who both their graces in thyself hast more\
    Outstript, than they did all that went before:\
    And present worth in all dost so contract,\
    As others speak, but only thou dost act.\
    Wear this renown. 'Tis just, that who did give\
    So many poets life, by one should live.\
\
(BEN JONSON: _Epigram LXXXIX, to Edward Allen._ 1616.)\
\
Jonson is thought by some to have been the founder of the classical\
school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which made the\
heroic couplet peculiarly its own. See on this subject an article by\
Prof. F. E. Schelling, "Ben Jonson and the Classical School," in the\
_Publications of the Modern Language Association_, n. s. vol. vi. p.\
221. Professor Schelling finds in Jonson's verse all the characteristics\
of the later couplet of Waller and Dryden: end-stopped lines and\
couplets, a preference for medial cesura, and an antithetical structure\
of the verse. "No better specimen of Jonson's antithetical manner could\
be found," he says further, than the Epigram here quoted. So far as this\
antithetical quality of Jonson's verse is concerned, Professor\
Schelling's view cannot be questioned; but that Jonson shows any\
singular preference for end-stopped lines and couplets may be seriously\
questioned.\

\
(WALLER: _The Battle of the Summer Islands_, canto i. 1638.)\
\
Edmund Waller is the chief representative of the early classical poetry\
of the seventeenth century, and of the polishing and regulating of the\
couplet which prepared the way for the verse of Dryden and Pope. The\
dominant characteristic of this verse is its avoidance of _enjambement_,\
or run-on lines, still more of run-on couplets. The growing precision of\
French verse at the same time was perhaps influential in England.\
Malherbe, who was at the French court after 1605, set rules for more\
regular verse, and forbade, among other things, the use of run-on\
lines--a precept which held good in French poetry until the nineteenth\
century. The influence of Waller in England was, for a considerable\
period, hardly less than that of Malherbe in France. Dryden said that\
"the excellence and dignity" of rime "were never known till Mr. Waller\
taught it; he first made writing easily an art; first showed us to\
conclude the sense most commonly in distichs, which, in the verse of\
those before him, runs on for so many lines together that the reader is\
out of breath to overtake it. This sweetness of Mr. Waller's lyric poesy\
was afterward followed, in the epic, by Sir John Denham, in his\
_Cooper's Hill_." (Epistle Dedicatory of _The Rival Ladies_.) In another\
place Dryden observed that only Waller, in English, had surpassed\
Spenser in the harmony of his verse. Dryden's view was later echoed by\
Pope, who exhorted his readers to\
\
             "praise the easy vigor of a line\
    Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join."\
\
(_Essay on Criticism_, l. 360.)\
\
But the most remarkable praise of Waller is found in the Preface to his\
posthumous poems, 1690, generally attributed to Bishop Atterbury. "He\
was indeed the parent of English verse, and the first that shewed us our\
tongue had beauty and numbers in it.... The tongue came into his hands\
like a rough diamond; he polished it first, and to that degree that all\
artists since him have admired the workmanship, without pretending to\
mend it.... He undoubtedly stands first in the list of refiners, and for\
aught I know, last, too; for I question whether in Charles the Second's\
reign English did not come to its full perfection; and whether it has\
not had its Augustan Age, as well as the Latin.... We are no less\
beholding to him for the new turn of verse, which he brought in, and the\
improvement he made in our numbers. Before his time men rhymed, indeed,\
and that was all: as for the harmony of measure, and that dance of words\
which good ears are so much pleased with, they knew nothing of it. Their\
poetry then was made up almost entirely of monosyllables, which, when\
they come together in any cluster, are certainly the most harsh,\
untunable things in the world. If any man doubts of this, let him read\
ten lines in Donne, and he'll quickly be convinced. Besides, their\
verses ran all into one another, and hung together, throughout a whole\
copy, like the _hook't atoms_ that compose a body in Des Cartes. There\
was no distinction of parts, no regular stops, nothing for the ear to\
rest upon. But as soon as the copy began, down it went like a larum,\
incessantly; and the reader was sure to be out of breath before he got\
to the end of it. So that really verse in those days was but downright\
prose, tagged with rhymes. Mr. Waller removed all these faults, brought\
in more polysyllables and smoother measures, bound up his thoughts\
better and in a cadence more agreeable to the nature of the verse he\
wrote in: so that wherever the natural stops of that were, he contrived\
the little breakings of his sense so as to fall in with 'em. And for\
that reason, since the stress of our verse lies commonly upon the last\
syllable, you'll hardly ever find him using a word of no force\
there."[21] Waller's editor thus clearly discerns the very\
characteristics of his verse which are avoided by the master-poets--the\
coincidence of phrase-pauses and verse-pauses, and regularity in the\
placing of stress.\
\
The most important discussion of the influence of Waller on English\
poetry, and on the heroic couplet in particular, is found in Mr. Gosse's\
book, _From Shakespeare to Pope_. Mr. Gosse regards Waller as inventing\
for himself the couplet of the classical school; "master," in 1623, of\
such verse as "was not imitated by a single poet for nearly twenty\
years" (p. 50). This view is criticised in an interesting article by Dr.\
Henry Wood, in the _American Journal of Philology_, vol. xi. p. 55.\
While Mr. Gosse places Waller's earliest couplets in 1621 and 1623, Dr.\
Wood would date them as late as 1626, and shows that Waller wrote\
nothing else until 1635. Meantime had appeared (the first volume at\
least as early as 1623) the translation of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, by\
George Sandys, in which, says Wood, all the characteristics of Waller's\
verse appear. "At all events," is his conclusion, "it was Sandys, and\
not Waller, who at the beginning of the third decade of the century,\
first of all Englishmen, made a uniform practice of writing in heroic\
couplets, which are, on the whole, in accord with the French rule, and\
which, for exactness of construction, and for harmonious sification, go\
far towards satisfying the demands of the later 'classical' school in\
England." Dr. Wood emphasizes the probable influence of the French poets\
on these early heroic couplets, calling attention to the fact that\
Sandys was in France in 1610. There is no evidence, however, that he was\
there for more than a few days, _en route_ to more eastern countries.\
Waller was not in France till 1643. The whole question of the influence\
of French poetry in England before the Restoration still remains to be\
carefully investigated. Meantime, the cautious student will hesitate to\
put too much stress on any single point of departure for the new style\
of versification. Many influences must have combined to make it popular.\
We have seen Professor Schelling emphasizing the influence of Jonson; he\
also very justly points out "that it is a mistake to consider that the\
Elizabethans often practised the couplet with the freedom, not to say\
license, that characterizes its nineteenth century use in the hands of\
such poets as Keats." Compare the couplets of even so romantic a poet as\
Marlowe, in the specimen given above from _Hero and Leander_. And even\
Mr. Gosse, in partial divergence from the doctrines of _From Shakespeare\
to Pope_, says of the satiric verse of the Elizabethan Rowlands: "There\
are lines in this passage which Pope would not have disdained to use. It\
might, indeed, be employed as against that old heresy, not even yet\
entirely discarded, that smoothness of heroic verse was the invention of\
Waller. As a matter of fact, this, as well as all other branches of the\
universal art of poetry, was understood by the great Elizabethan\
masters; and if they did not frequently employ it, it was because they\
left to such humbler writers as Rowlands an instrument incapable of\
those noble and audacious harmonies on which they chiefly prided\
themselves." (Introduction to the _Works of Rowlands_, Hunterian Club\
ed., p. 16.)\
\
A tribute to the incoming influence of the couplet is cited by Dr. Wood\
from the poems of Sir John Beaumont (1582-1627). In his verses _To His\
Late Majesty, concerning the True Forme of English Poetry_, Beaumont\
said:\
\
    "In every language now in Europe spoke\
    By nations which the Roman empire broke,\
    The rellish of the Muse consists in rime,\
    One verse must meete another like a chime....\
    In many changes these may be exprest,\
    But those that joyne most simply run the best:\
    Their forme surpassing farre the fetter'd staves,\
    Vaine care, and needlesse repetition saves."\
\
(CHALMER'S _English Poets_, vol. vi. p. 31.)[22]\

    Like mortal life to meet eternity....\
    No unexpected inundations spoil\
    The mower's hopes, nor mock the ploughman's toil,\
    But godlike his unwearied bounty flows,\

    Nor are his blessings to his banks confined,\
    But free and common as the sea or wind....\
      O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream\
    My great example, as it is my theme!\
    Though deep, yet clear, though gentle, yet not dull,\
    Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.\

(SIR JOHN DENHAM: _Cooper's Hill_. 1642.)\
\
"Denham," says Mr. Gosse, "was the first writer to adopt the precise\
manner of versification introduced by Waller." (Ward's _English Poets_,\
vol. ii. p. 279.) On his praise by Dryden and Pope, see notes on p. 188\
above. The last four lines of the specimen here given have been\
universally admired.\

    The senseless rout to slavishness and fear,\
    Ne'er known to awe the brave, and those that dare.\
    Such weak and feeble things may serve for checks\

    Such whom fond in-bred honesty befools,\
    Or that old musty piece, the Bible, gulls.\
\
(JOHN OLDHAM: _Satires upon the Jesuits_, Sat. i. 1679.)\
\
"Oldham was the first," says Mr. Gosse, "to liberate himself, in the use\
of the distich, from this under-current of a stanza, and to write heroic\
verse straight on, couplet by couplet, ascending by steady strides and\
not by irregular leaps. (Any one who will venture to read Oldham's\
disagreeable _Satire upon the Jesuits_, written in 1679, will see the\
truth of this remark, and note the effect that its versification had\
upon that series of Dryden's satires which immediately followed it.) In\
Pope's best satires we see this art carried to its final perfection;\
after his time the connecting link between couplet and couplet became\
lost, and at last in the decline poems became, as some one has said,\
mere cases of lancets lying side by side. But in Dryden's day the\
connection was still only too obvious, and it strikes me that it may\
have been from a consciousness of this defect, that Dryden adopted that\
triplet, with a final alexandrine, which he is so fond of introducing."\
(_From Shakespeare to Pope_, p. 201.)\
\
    Of these the false Achitophel was first,\
    A name to all succeeding ages curst:\
    For close designs and crooked counsels fit,\
    Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit,\
    Restless, unfixed in principles and place,\
    In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace;\
    A fiery soul, which, working out its way,\
    Fretted the pigmy body to decay,\
    And o'er-informed the tenement of clay.\
    A daring pilot in extremity,\
    Pleased with the danger, when the waves went high,\
    He sought the storms; but, for a calm unfit,\
    Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.\
    Great wits are sure to madness near allied,\
    And thin partitions do their bounds divide;\
    Else, why should he, with wealth and honor blest,\
    Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?\
    Punish a body which he could not please,\
    Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?...\
    In friendship false, implacable in hate,\
    Resolved to ruin or to rule the state;\
    To compass this the triple bond he broke,\
    The pillars of the public safety shook,\
    And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke;\
    Then, seized with fear, yet still affecting fame,\
    Usurped a patriot's all-atoning name.\
\
(DRYDEN: _Absalom and Achitophel_, part I. ll. 150-179. 1681.)\
\
Dryden was the first great English poet after Chaucer to make the heroic\
couplet his chief vehicle of expression, and he put far more variety and\
vigor into it than had been achieved by his nearer predecessors. As Pope\
said:\
\
    "Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join\
    The varying verse, the full resounding line,\
    The long majestic march, the energy divine."\
\
(_Epistle ii._, 267.)\
\
And Gray, some years later, symbolized Dryden's couplet in these fine\
lines of the _Progress of Poesy_:\
\
    "Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car,\
        Wide o'er the fields of glory bear\
        Two coursers of ethereal race,\
    With necks in thunder clothed, and long-resounding pace."\
\
On Dryden's development of the couplet, see especially Saintsbury's\
_Life of Dryden_ (English Men of Letters Series), pp. 17, 171. "The\
whole structure of the decasyllabic line before the middle of the\
seventeenth century was ill calculated for the perfecting of the\
couplet. Accustomed either to the stately plainness of blank verse, or\
to the elaborate intricacies of the stanza, writers had got into the\
habit of communicating to their verse a slow and somewhat languid\
movement." (p. 17.) "In versification the great achievement of Dryden\
was the alteration of what may be called the balance of the line,\
causing it to run more quickly, and to strike its rhymes with a sharper\
and less prolonged sound. One obvious means of obtaining this was, as a\
matter of course, the isolation of the couplet, and the avoidance of\
overlapping the different lines one upon the other. The effect of this\
overlapping, by depriving the eye and voice of the expectation of rest\
at the end of each couplet, is always one of two things. Either the\
lines are converted into a sort of rhythmic prose, made musical by the\
rhymes rather than divided by them, or else a considerable pause is\
invited at the end of each, or of most lines, and the cadence of the\
whole becomes comparatively slow and languid. Both these forms, as may\
be seen in the works of Mr. Morris, as well as in the older writers, are\
excellently suited for narration of some considerable length. They are\
less well suited for satire, for argument, and for the moral reflections\
which the age of Dryden loved. He therefore set himself to elaborate the\
couplet with its sharp point, its quick delivery, and the pistol-like\
detonation of its rhyme. But there is an obvious objection, or rather\
there are several obvious objections which present themselves to the\
couplet. It was natural that to one accustomed to the more varied range\
of the older rhythm and metre, there might seem to be a danger of the\
snip-snap monotony into which, as we know, it did actually fall when it\
passed out of the hands of its first great practitioners. There might\
also be a fear that it would not always be possible to compress the\
sense of a complete clause within the narrow limits of twenty syllables.\
To meet these difficulties Dryden resorted to three mechanical\
devices--the hemistich, the alexandrine, and the triplet, all three of\
which could be used indifferently to eke out the space or to give\
variety of sound.... In poetry proper the hemistich is anything but\
pleasing, and Dryden, becoming convinced of the fact, almost discarded\
it. The alexandrine and the triplet he always continued to use." (pp.\
171, 172.)\
\
    Do you remember, when their tasks were done,\
    How all the youth did to our cottage run?\
    While winter winds were whistling loud without,\
    Our cheerful hearth was circled round about:\
    With strokes in ashes, maids their lovers drew;\
    And still you fell to me, and I to you....\
     I know too well when first my love began,\
    When at our wake you for the chaplet ran:\
    Then I was made the lady of the May,\
    And, with the garland, at the goal did stay:\
    Still, as you ran, I kept you full in view;\
    I hoped, and wished, and ran, methought, for you.\
    As you came near, I hastily did rise,\
    And stretched my arm outright, that held the prize.\
    The custom was to kiss whom I should crown;\
    You kneeled, and in my lap your head laid down:\
    I blushed, and blushed, and did the kiss delay;\
    At last my subjects forced me to obey:\
    But, when I gave the crown, and then the kiss,\
    I scarce had breath to say, Take that,--and this.\
\
(DRYDEN: _Marriage \'e0 la Mode_, II, i. 1672.)\
\
The use of the heroic couplet in the drama marks its effort to conquer\
the last citadel of English poetry; an attempt which, under the\
leadership of Dryden, seemed to succeed, but soon gave way to better\
judgment. Dryden favored the experiment in the Preface to _The Rival\
Ladies_ (1663), and inserted a few couplets in that play. Etheredge\
accepted the suggestion, and put the serious parts of _The Comical\
Revenge_ (largely prose) into couplets, in 1664. In the same year _The\
Indian Queen_ (by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard) appeared in heroic\
verse, and the fashion soon became so general that in the _Essay on\
Heroic Plays_, prefixed to _The Conquest of Granada_ (1672), Dryden\
could say: "Whether Heroic Verse ought to be admitted into serious\
plays, is not now to be disputed: 'tis already in possession of the\
stage; and I dare confidently affirm, that very few tragedies, in this\
age, shall be received without it." Only six years later, however, in\
1678, he returned to blank verse in _All for Love_, saying: "I have\
disencumbered myself from rhyme. Not that I condemn my former way, but\
that this is more proper to my present purpose." In all about five\
plays of Dryden's are in couplets; after 1678 he rarely returned to rime\
for the drama. As Atterbury said in his Preface to Waller's poems:\
"'Twas the strength of his genius that first brought it into credit in\
plays; and 'tis the force of his example that has thrown it out again."\
"The fashion of rhyme in the drama, then, to be exact," says Mr. Gosse,\
"flourished from 1664 until ... 1678." Some justification for its use is\
to be found in the wretched condition into which blank verse had fallen.\
"The blank iambics of the romantic dramatists had become so execrably\
weak and distended, the whole movement of dramatic verse had grown so\
flaccid, that a little restraint in the severe limits of rhyme was\
absolutely necessary." (Gosse, in _Seventeenth Century Studies_, p.\
264.)\
\
The present specimen is from a play in which the couplet was used but\
slightly; but it shows Dryden's use of it at its best. In the drama, as\
already remarked, the couplet is naturally less epigrammatic and pointed\
than in didactic and satiric verse.\
\
     For the arguments with which Dryden defended the use of rime in the\
     drama, see the Preface to _The Rival Ladies_, the _Essay of Heroic\
     Plays_, the _Essay of Dramatic Poesy_, and the _Defence of an Essay\
     of Dramatic Poesy_. "In the quickness of reparties (which in\
     discoursive scenes fall very often), it has so particular a grace,\
     and is so aptly suited to them, that the sudden smartness of the\
     answer, and the sweetness of the rhyme, set off the beauty of each\
     other. But that benefit which I consider most in it, because I have\
     not seldom found it, is, that it bounds and circumscribes the\
     fancy." (_Essays of Dryden_, ed. W. P. Ker, vol. i. p. 8.) In the\
     _Essay of Dramatic Poesy_, Crites, representing Sir Robert Howard,\
     opposes the use of rime on the ground of Aristotle's dictum that\
     tragedy is best written in the kind of verse which is nearest\
     prose. A play being an imitation of Nature, "the nearer anything\
     comes to the imitation of it, the more it pleases." Neander,\
     representing Dryden, answers that this line of argument will\
     equally forbid blank verse. Blank verse is "properly but measured\
     prose"; and rime may be "made as natural as blank verse, by the\
     well placing of the words, etc." "But I need not go so far to prove\
     that rhyme, as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin\
     verse, so especially to this of plays, since the custom of all\
     nations at this day confirms it, all the French, Italian, and\
     Spanish tragedies are generally writ in it; and sure the universal\
     consent of the most civilized parts of the world ought in this, as\
     it doth in other customs, to include the rest." (_Ibid._ p. 98.)\
     Again, while a play is a representation of Nature, it is "Nature\
     wrought up to an higher pitch"; and for this purpose "heroic rhyme\
     is nearest Nature, as being the noblest kind of modern verse." (pp.\
     100, 101.) In the _Essay of Heroic Plays_ Dryden again summarizes\
     the case for the other side by saying that "all the arguments which\
     are formed against it can amount to no more than this, that it is\
     not so near conversation as prose, and therefore not so natural.\
     But it is very clear to all who understand Poetry, that serious\
     plays ought not to imitate conversation too nearly." If, therefore,\
     we begin to leave the mere "imitation of ordinary converse," we\
     should go on consistently to "the last perfection of Art. It was\
     only custom which cozened us so long; we thought, because\
     Shakespeare and Fletcher went no farther, that there the pillars of\
     poetry were to be erected; that, because they excellently described\
     passion without rhyme, therefore rhyme was not capable of\
     describing it. But time has now convinced most men of that error."\
     (_Ibid._ pp. 148, 149.)\

     Dryden was of course quite right in objecting to the claim that\
     imaginative poetry ought to seek the form closest to the language\
     of real life. The real question is whether rimed verse is a more\
     imaginative and highly poetic form than blank verse; modern opinion\
     would unanimously answer in the negative.\
\
     It strikes a modern reader as curious that Dryden and his\
     contemporaries should have advocated the use of rime in tragedy\
     rather than in comedy; but we have the clew to their feeling in the\
     saying that "_serious plays_ ought not to imitate conversation too\
     nearly." In the Restoration period the comedy was thought of as a\
     realistic representation of life; hence its characters should speak\
     in natural prose, as they have continued to do, for the most part,\
     ever since. The tragedy or heroic play, on the other hand, was in\
     the region of artistic convention, much farther removed from\
     reality; hence its language was to be "raised above the life." This\
     distinction between the range of comedy and that of tragedy, which\
     would have seemed strange to the Elizabethans, explains the widely\
     diverging lines which we find the two forms of the drama following\
     from the time of the Restoration.\
\
     On the verse of Dryden's rimed plays, see Schipper, vol. ii. p.\
     214, and O. Speerschneider's _Metrische Untersuchungen \'fcber den\
     heroischen Vers in John Drydens Dramen_ (Halle, 1897).\
\
    But O, my muse, what numbers wilt thou find\
    To sing the furious troops in battle join'd!\
    Methinks I hear the drum's tumultuous sound,\
    The victor's shouts and dying groans confound,\
    The dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies,\
    And all the thunder of the battle rise.\
    'Twas then great Marlbro's mighty soul was prov'd,\
    That, in the shock of charging hosts unmov'd,\
    Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\
    Examin'd all the dreadful scenes of war....\
    So, when an angel by divine command\
    With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\
    Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past,\
    Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\
    And pleas'd th' Almighty's orders to perform,\
    Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.\
\
(ADDISON: _The Campaign_. 1704.)\
\
    But most by numbers judge a poet's song,\
    And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong:\
    In the bright Muse, tho' thousand charms conspire,\
    Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;\
    Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,\
    Not mend their minds; as some to church repair,\
    Not for the doctrine, but the music there.\
    These equal syllables alone require,\
    Tho' oft the ear the open vowels tire;\
    While expletives their feeble aid do join;\
    And ten low words oft creep in one dull line;\
    While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,\
    With sure return of still expected rhymes;\
    Where'er you find 'the cooling western breeze,'\
    In the next line, it 'whispers through the trees';\
    If crystal streams 'with pleasing murmurs creep,'\
    The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with 'sleep':\
    Then, at the last and only couplet fraught\
    With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,\
    A needless alexandrine ends the song,\
    That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.\
    Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know\
    What's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;\
    And praise the easy vigor of a line\
    Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join.\
\
(POPE: _Essay on Criticism_, ll. 337-361. 1711.)\
\
    Why boast we, Glaucus, our extended reign\
    Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,\
    Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,\
    And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,\
    Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crowned,\
    Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?\
    Why on those shores are we with joy surveyed,\
    Admired as heroes, and as gods obeyed;\
    Unless great acts superior merit prove,\
    And vindicate the bounteous powers above?\
    'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;\
    The first in valor, as the first in place:\
    That when with wondering eyes our martial bands\
    Behold our deeds transcending our commands,\
    Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,\
    Whom those that envy dare not imitate!\
    Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,\
    Which claims no less the fearful than the brave,\
    For lust of fame I should not vainly dare\
    In fighting fields, nor urge the soul to war.\
    But since, alas! ignoble age must come,\
    Disease, and death's inexorable doom;\
    The life which others pay let us bestow,\
    And give to fame what we to nature owe;\
    Brave though we fall, and honored if we live,\
    Or let us glory gain, or glory give!\
\
(POPE: _Iliad_, bk. xii.)\
\
Pope's couplet, while less vigorous and varied than Dryden's, has been\
generally considered the most perfect development of the typical measure\
of the classical school. Mr. Courthope thinks that in this speech from\
the _Iliad_, Pope "perhaps attains the highest level of which the heroic\
couplet is capable." (_Works of Pope_, vol. v. p. 167.)\
\
     "What he learned from Dryden," Mr. Courthope says in another place,\
     "was the art of expressing the social and conversational idiom of\
     the language in a metrical form. His conception of metrical harmony\
     was, however, altogether different from his professed master's, and\
     rather resembled that of Sandys, whose translation of Ovid's\
     _Metamorphoses_ he told Spence he had read when very young, and\
     with the greatest delight. He explains the system in a letter to\
     Cromwell, dated November 25, 1710.\
\
     "'(1) As to the hiatus, it is certainly to be avoided as often as\
     possible; but on the other hand, since the reason of it is only for\
     the sake of the numbers, so if, to avoid it, we incur another fault\
     against their smoothness, methinks the very end of that nicety is\
     destroyed....\
\
     "'(2) I would except against the use of all expletives in verse, as\
     _do_ before verbs plural, or even the frequent use of _did_ or\
     _does_ to change the termination of the rhyme....\
\
     "'(3) Monosyllable lines, unless very artfully managed, are stiff,\
     languishing, and hard.\
\
     "'(4) The repeating the same rhymes within four or six lines of\
     each other, which tire the ear with too much of the like sound.\
\
     "'(5) The too frequent use of alexandrines, which are never\
     graceful, but where there is some majesty added to the verse by\
     them, or when there cannot be found a word in them but what is\
     absolutely needful.\
\
     "'(6) Every nice ear must, I believe, have observed that in any\
     smooth English verse of ten syllables, there is naturally a pause\
     either at the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllables.... Now I fancy\
     that, to preserve an exact harmony and variety, none of these\
     pauses should be continued above three lines together, without the\
     interposition of another; else it will be apt to weary the ear with\
     one continued tone.'"\
\
     (_Ibid._ pp. 20, 21.)\
\
     Here are implied all the characteristics of the Popean couplet. The\
     cesura is to vary, but not from a fundamentally medial position.\
     The avoidance of _enjambement_ is not mentioned, doubtless because\
     it is assumed as an essential of couplets professing any degree of\
     correctness.\
\
Mr. Andrew Lang protests against the monotony of the verse of Pope's\
_Iliad_ in some lines which cleverly adopt the same sort of measure:\
\
    My childhood fled your couplet's clarion tone,\
    And sought for Homer in the prose of Bohn.\
    Still through the dust of that dim prose appears\
    The flight of arrows and the sheen of spears;\
    Still we may trace what hearts heroic feel,\
    And hear the bronze that hurtles on the steel!\
    But ah, your Iliad seems a half-pretence,\
    Where wits, not heroes, prove their skill in fence,\
    And great Achilles' eloquence doth show\
    As if no centaur trained him, but Boileau!\
    Again, your verse is orderly,--and more,--\
    "The waves behind impel the waves before";\
    Monotonously musical they glide,\
    Till couplet unto couplet hath replied.\
    But turn to Homer! How his verses sweep!\
    Surge answers surge and deep doth call on deep;\
    This line in foam and thunder issues forth,\
    Spurred by the West or smitten by the North,\
    Sombre in all its sullen deeps, and all\
    Clear at the crest, and foaming to the fall;\
    The next with silver murmur dies away,\
    Like tides that falter to Calypso's Bay!\
\
(ANDREW LANG: _Letters to Dead Authors; Pope_.)\
\
Compare with this the equally clever defence of Pope's verse by Mr.\
Dobson:\
\
    Suppose you say your Worst of Pope, declare\
    His Jewels Paste, his Nature a Parterre,\
    His Art but Artifice--I ask once more\
    Where have you seen such Artifice before?\
    Where have you seen a Parterre better grac'd,\
    Or gems that glitter like his Gems of Paste?\
    Where can you show, among your Names of Note,\
    So much to copy and so much to quote?\
    And where, in Fine, in all our English Verse,\
    A Style more trenchant and a Sense more terse?\
    So I, that love the old Augustan Days\
    Of formal Courtesies and formal Phrase;\
    That like along the finish'd line to feel\
    The Ruffle's Flutter and the Flash of Steel;\
    That like my Couplet as compact as clear;\
    That like my Satire sparkling tho' severe,\
    Unmix'd with Bathos and unmarr'd by Trope,\
    I fling my Cap for Polish--and for POPE![23]\
\
(AUSTIN DOBSON: _Dialogue to the Memory of Mr. Alexander Pope_.)\
\
    Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening's close\
    Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;\
    There, as I passed with careless steps and slow,\
    The mingling notes came softened from below;\
    The swain responsive as the milkmaid sung,\
    The sober herd that lowed to meet their young;\
    The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,\
    The playful children just let loose from school;\
    The watchdog's voice that bayed the whispering wind,\
    And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;\
    These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,\
    And filled each pause the nightingale had made.\
    But now the sounds of population fail,\
    No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,\
    No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,\
    For all the bloomy flush of life is fled.\
\
(GOLDSMITH: _The Deserted Village_. 1770.)\
\
"The heroic couplet," says Mr. Gosse, "was never employed, even by Pope\
himself, with more melody than by Goldsmith in this poem." (_Eighteenth\
Century Literature_, p. 320.) Its use at this time, when the revival of\
blank verse by Thomson and others had seriously affected the prestige of\
the couplet, was a sign of Goldsmith's reactionary tendency toward the\
school of Pope. His dislike of blank verse he expressed in his early\
work on the _Present State of Polite Learning_, saying that it might be\
reckoned among "several disagreeable instances of pedantry" lately\
proceeding "from a desire in the critic of grafting the spirit of\
ancient languages upon the English." (_Works_, Globe ed., p. 439.) This\
opinion was of course shared by Goldsmith's friend, Dr. Johnson, whose\
two important poems (_London_ and _The Vanity of Human Wishes_) stand\
with the two of Goldsmith as the last notable pieces of English poetry\
of the classical school. While Johnson admitted that he could not "wish\
that Milton had been a rhymer," yet he never lost an opportunity to\
speak contemptuously of blank verse as a poetic form, and quoted\
approvingly the saying of a critic that it "seems to be verse only to\
the eye." (_Life of Milton._)\
\
      In front of these came Addison. In him\
    Humor, in holiday and sightly trim,\
    Sublimity and Attic taste combined\
    To polish, furnish, and delight the mind.\
    Then Pope, as harmony itself exact,\
    In verse well-disciplined, complete, compact,\
    Gave virtue and morality a grace\
    That, quite eclipsing pleasure's painted face,\
    Levied a tax of wonder and applause,\
    Even on the fools that trampled on their laws.\
    But he (his musical finesse was such,\
    So nice his ear, so delicate his touch)\
    Made poetry a mere mechanic art,\
    And every warbler has his tune by heart.\
    Nature imparting her satiric gift,\
    Her serious mirth, to Arbuthnot and Swift,\
    With droll sobriety they raised a smile\
    At folly's cost, themselves unmoved the while.\
    That constellation set, the world in vain\
    Must hope to look upon their like again.\
\
(COWPER: _Table Talk_. 1782.)\
\
    Behold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,\
    For notice eager, pass in long review:\
    Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,\
    And rhyme and blank maintain an equal race;\
    Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;\
    And tales of terror jostle on the road;\
    Immeasurable measures move along;\
    For simpering folly loves a varied song,\
    To strange mysterious dulness still the friend,\
    Admires the strain she cannot comprehend.\
    Thus Lays of Minstrels--may they be the last!--\
    On half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast;\
    While mountain spirits prate to river sprites,\
    That dames may listen to the sound at nights;\
    And goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's brood,\
    Decoy young border-nobles through the wood,\
    And skip at every step, Lord knows how high,\
    And frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why.\
\
(BYRON: _English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_. 1809.)\
\
    View now the winter storm! above, one cloud,\
    Black and unbroken, all the skies o'ershroud:\
    The unwieldy porpoise through the day before\
    Had rolled in view of boding men on shore;\
    And sometimes hid and sometimes showed his form,\
    Dark as the cloud and furious as the storm.\
    All where the eye delights yet dreads to roam,\
    The breaking billows cast the flying foam\
    Upon the billows rising--all the deep\
    Is restless change; the waves so swelled and steep,\
    Breaking and sinking, and the sunken swells,\
    Nor one, one moment, in its station dwells....\
      Darkness begins to reign; the louder wind\
    Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind;\
    But frights not him whom evening and the spray\
    In part conceal--yon prowler on his way.\
    Lo, he has something seen; he runs apace,\
    As if he feared companion in the chase;\
    He sees his prize, and now he turns again,\
    Slowly and sorrowing--"Was your search in vain?"\
    Gruffly he answers, "'Tis a sorry sight!\
    A seaman's body: there'll be more to-night!"\
\
(CRABBE: _The Borough_, letter i. 1810.)\
\
Crabbe's poems are the latest to use the strict Popean couplet for\
narrative and descriptive purposes, and his couplets have a certain\
characteristic reticence and vigor. Professor Woodberry praises them in\
an interesting passage on "the old heroic rhymed couplet, that simplest\
form of English verse music, which could rise, nevertheless, to the\
almost lyric loftiness of the last lines of the _Dunciad_; so supple and\
flexible; made for easy simile and compact metaphor; lending itself so\
perfectly to the sudden flash of wit or turn of humor; the natural shell\
of an epigram; compelling the poet to practice all the virtues of\
brevity; checking the wandering fancy, and repressing the secondary\
thought; requiring in a masterly use of it the employment of more mental\
powers than any other metrical form; despised and neglected now because\
the literature which is embodied in it is despised and neglected, yet\
the best metrical form which intelligence, as distinct from poetical\
feeling, can employ." (_Makers of Literature_, p. 104.)\
\
    The flower-beds all were liberal of delight:\
    Roses in heaps were there, both red and white,\
    Lilies angelical, and gorgeous glooms\
    Of wall-flowers, and blue hyacinths, and blooms\
    Hanging thick clusters from light boughs; in short,\
    All the sweet cups to which the bees resort;\
    With plots of grass, and leafier walks between\
    Of red geraniums, and of jessamine,\
    And orange, whose warm leaves so finely suit,\
    And look as if they shade a golden fruit;\
    And midst the flowers, turfed round beneath a shade\
    Of darksome pines, a babbling fountain played,\
    And 'twixt their shafts you saw the water bright,\
    Which through the tops glimmered with showering light.\
\
(LEIGH HUNT: _The Story of Rimini_. 1816.)\
\
Of this poem Mr. C. H. Herford says: "_The Story of Rimini_ is the\
starting-point of that free or Chaucerian treatment of the heroic\
couplet, and of the colloquial style, eschewing epigram and full of\
familiar turns, which Shelley in _Julian and Maddalo_ and Keats in\
_Lamia_ made classical." (_Age of Wordsworth_, p. 83.) The treatment of\
the couplet is still characterized by but slight use of run-on lines,\
and a preference for the medial cesura; but on the other hand there is a\
large degree of freedom in the inversion of accents and other\
alterations of the regular stress. Compare the last line of the present\
specimen, and such other lines as\
\
    "Of crimson cloths hanging a hand of snow."\
    "Some, with a drag, dangling from the cap's crest."\
    "'Who's there?' said that sweet voice, kindly and clear."\
    "The other with the tears streaming down both his cheeks."\
\
The last of these lines, an alexandrine, is also characteristic. Hunt\
imitated Dryden in the use of both alexandrine and triplet. Of the\
latter he said: "I confess I like the very bracket that marks out the\
triplet to the reader's eye, and prepares him for the music of it. It\
has a look like the bridge of a lute." (Preface to _Works_, 1832.) Mr.\
A. J. Kent, in an article in the _Fortnightly Review_, says of Leigh\
Hunt that "he became the greatest master since the days of Dryden" of\
the heroic couplet. (1881, p. 224.)\
\
    A thing of beauty is a joy forever:\
    Its loveliness increases; it will never\
    Pass into nothingness; but still will keep\
    A bower quiet for us, and a sleep\
    Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\
    Therefore, on every morrow are we wreathing\
    A flowery band to bind us to the earth,\
    Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\
    Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,\
    Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways\
    Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\
    Some shape of beauty moves away the pall\
    From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\
    Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\
    For simple sheep; and such are daffodils\
    With the green world they live in; and clear rills\
    That for themselves a cooling covert make\
    'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,\
    Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\
    And such too is the grandeur of the dooms\
    We have imagined for the mighty dead;\
    All lovely tales that we have heard or read:\
    An endless fountain of immortal drink,\
    Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\
\
(KEATS: _Endymion_, ll. 1-24. 1818.)\
\
In the couplet of Keats, and of a number of his successors, we have a\
really different measure from the "heroic couplet" proper. The\
individual line and the couplet alike cease to be prominent units of\
the verse. The effect is therefore closely allied to that of blank\
verse; the rimes, not being emphasized by marked pauses, serving rather\
as means of tone color than as organizers of the verse. See Mr.\
Saintsbury's remarks (quoted in the notes on Dryden, p. 195, above), on\
"lines made musical by the rhymes rather than divided by them." In like\
manner Mr. Symonds says that "the couplets of Marlowe, Fletcher,\
Shelley, and Keats follow the laws of blank verse, and add rhyme--that\
is to say, their periods and pauses are entirely determined by the\
sense." (_Blank Verse_, p. 66.) This is true of the couplets of Shelley\
and Keats, and to a less degree of those of Fletcher's _Faithful\
Shepherdess_, but will hardly apply to Marlowe, nor, as we have seen, to\
the Elizabethans in general.[24]\
\
    There was a Being whom my spirit oft\
    Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,\
    In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn.\
    Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,\
    Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves\
    Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves\
    Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor\
    Paved her light steps;--on an imagined shore,\
    Under the gray beak of some promontory\
    She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,\
    That I beheld her not.\
\
(SHELLEY: _Epipsychidion_, ll. 190-200. 1821.)\
\
Shelley carries the free treatment of this measure to the utmost limit.\
The couplet is not felt to be of significance, and many lines are so\
irregular in stress as to make scansion difficult. Compare this\
passage:\
\
    "The ringdove in the embowering ivy yet\
    Keeps up her love-lament; and the owls flit\
    Round the evening tower; and the young stars glance\
    Between the quick bats in their twilight dance."[25]\
\
    The woods were long austere with snow: at last\
    Pink leaflets budded on the beech, and fast\
    Larches, scattered through pine-tree solitudes,\
    Brightened, 'as in the slumbrous heart o' the woods\
    Our buried year, a witch, grew young again\
    To placid incantations, and that stain\
    About were from her caldron, green smoke blent\
    With those black pines'--so Eglamor gave vent\
    To a chance fancy. When a just rebuke\
    From his companion; brother Naddo shook\
    The solemnest of brows; 'Beware,' he said,\
    'Of setting up conceits in nature's stead.'\
\
(BROWNING: _Sordello_, ii. 1-12. 1840.)\
\
    Above the stem a gilded swallow shone,\
    Wrought with straight wings and eyes of glittering stone\
    As flying sunward oversea, to bear\
    Green summer with it through the singing air.\
    And on the deck between the rowers at dawn,\
    As the bright sail with brightening wind was drawn,\
    Sat with full face against the strengthening light\
    Iseult, more fair than foam or dawn was white.\
    Her gaze was glad past love's own singing of,\
    And her face lovely past desire of love.\
    Past thought and speech her maiden motions were,\
    And a more golden sunrise was her hair.\
    The very veil of her bright flesh was made\
    As of light woven and moonbeam-colored shade\
    More fine than moonbeams; white her eyelids shone\
    As snow sun-stricken that endures the sun,\
    And through their curled and colored clouds of deep\
    Luminous lashes, thick as dreams in sleep,\
    Shone as the sea's depth swallowing up the sky's\
    The springs of unimaginable eyes.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Tristram of Lyonesse; the Sailing of the Swallow_.)\
\
    The huge high presence, red as earth's first race,\
    Reared like a reed the might up of his mace,\
    And smote: but lightly Tristram swerved, and drove\
    Right in on him, whose void stroke only clove\
    Air, and fell wide, thundering athwart: and he\
    Sent forth a stormier cry than wind or sea\
    When midnight takes the tempest for her lord;\
    And all the glen's throat seemed as hell's that roared;\
    But high like heaven's light over hell shone Tristram's sword,\
    Falling, and bright as storm shows God's bare brand\
    Flashed, as it shore sheer off the huge right hand\
    Whose strength was as the shadow of death on all that land.\
\
(_Ibid._: _The Last Pilgrimage_.)\
\
It will be noticed that in Swinburne's use of the couplet the single\
line is even less the unit of measure than in Keats and Shelley; the\
periods correspond closely to those in the blank verse of Milton and\
Tennyson. Compare the specimens of blank verse on pp. 230 and 245. The\
second specimen shows the occasional use of the triplet and\
alexandrine.\
\
    So stood she murmuring, till a rippling sound\
    She heard, that grew until she turned her round\
    And saw her other sisters of the deep\
    Her song had called while Hylas yet did sleep,\
    Come swimming in a long line up the stream,\
    And their white dripping arms and shoulders gleam\
    Above the dark grey water as they went,\
    And still before them a great ripple sent.\
    But when they saw her, toward the bank they drew,\
    And landing, felt the grass and flowers blue\
    Against their unused feet; then in a ring\
    Stood gazing with wide eyes, and wondering\
    At all his beauty they desired so much.\
    And then with gentle hands began to touch\
    His hair, his hands, his closed eyes; and at last\
    Their eager naked arms about him cast,\
    And bore him, sleeping still, as by some spell,\
    Unto the depths where they were wont to dwell;\
    Then softly down the reedy bank they slid,\
    And with small noise the gurgling river hid\
    The flushed nymphs and the heedless sleeping man.\
\
(WILLIAM MORRIS: _Life and Death of Jason_, iv. 621-641. 1867.)\
\
\
B.--BLANK VERSE\
\
Unrimed five-stress verse early became the accepted form for English\
dramatic poetry, and in the modern English period has become the\
favorite form for long continuous poems, narrative and reflective as\
well. In general, as will appear from the specimens, it is marked not\
only by the absence of rime but by a prevalent freedom of structure\
rarely found in the couplet.\
\
The impetus toward the writing of blank verse seems to have been given\
by the influence of classical humanism, the representatives of which\
grew sceptical as to the use of rime, on the ground that it was not\
found in classical poetry. In Italy Giovanni Trissino wrote his\
_Sophonisbe_ and _Italia Liberata_ (1515-1548) in rimeless verses, and\
was looked upon as the inventor of _versi sciolti_, _i.e._ verses\
"freed" from rime. (See Schipper, vol. ii. p. 4.) See also below, in the\
notes on Surrey, and later under Imitations of Classical Verse, for\
notes on the same movement.\
\
On the nature of English blank verse, see J. A. Symonds's _Blank Verse_\
(1895), a reprint of essays in the Appendix to his _Sketches and Studies\
in Southern Europe_. In his _Chapters on English Metre_ (chap. iv.), Mr.\
J. B. Mayor criticises what he calls Mr. Symonds's "\'e6sthetic\
intuitivism."\
\
On the early history of English blank verse, see the article by Schr\'f6er,\
_Anf\'e4nge des Blankverses in England, Anglia_, vol. iv. p. 1, and Mr. G.\
C. Macaulay's _Francis Beaumont_, pp. 39-49.\
\
Of Mr. Symonds's remarks on the general nature of blank verse the\
following are especially interesting: "English blank verse is perhaps\
more various and plastic than any other national metre. It is capable of\
being used for the most commonplace and the most sublime utterances....\
Originally instituted for the drama, it received in Milton's hands an\
epical treatment, and has by authors of our own day been used for\
idyllic and even for lyrical compositions. Plato mentions a Greek\
musical instrument called _panharmonion_, which was adapted to express\
the different modes and systems of melodious utterance. This name might\
be applied to our blank verse; there is no harmony of sound, no dignity\
of movement, no swiftness, no subtlety of languid sweetness, no brevity,\
no force of emphasis, beyond its scope." (_Blank Verse_, pp. 16, 17.)\
\
"It seems adapted specially for thought in evolution; it requires\
progression and sustained effort. As a consequence of this, its melody\
is determined by the sense which it contains, and depends more upon\
proportion and harmony of sounds than upon recurrences and regularities\
of structure.... Another point about blank verse is that it admits of no\
mediocrity; it must be either clay or gold.... Hence, we find that blank\
verse has been the metre of genius, that it is only used successfully\
by indubitable poets, and that it is no favorite in a mean, contracted,\
and unimaginative age. The freedom of the renaissance created it in\
England. The freedom of our century has reproduced it. Blank verse is a\
type and symbol of our national literary spirit--uncontrolled by\
precedent or rule, inclined to extravagance, yet reaching perfection at\
intervals by an inner force and _vivida vis_ of native inspiration."\
(_Ibid._ pp. 70-72.)\
\
The earliest use of the term "blank verse," noted in the _New English\
Dictionary_, is in Nash's Preface to Greene's _Menaphon_, 1589: "the\
swelling bumbast of bragging blanke verse." Some ten years later\
Shakspere used it in _Much Ado about Nothing_, V. ii., where Benedick\
speaks of those heroes "whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of\
blank verse," but will not rime easily. In Chapman's _All Fools_ (1605)\
the young gallant, in describing his manifold accomplishments, says he\
could write\
\
    "Sonnets in Dozens, or your Quatorzains\
    In any rhyme, Masculine, Feminine,\
    Or Sdruciolla, or couplets, or Blank Verse."\
\
_Sdruciolla_ is the Italian term for triple-rimed endings.\
\
    Forthwith Fame flieth through the great Libyan towns:\
    A mischief Fame, there is none else so swift;\
    That moving grows, and flitting gathers force:\
    First small for dread, soon after climbs the skies,\
    Stayeth on earth, and hides her head in clouds.\
    Whom our mother the Earth, tempted by wrath\
    Of gods, begat: the last sister, they write,\
    To C\'9cus, and to Enceladus eke:\
    Speedy of foot, of wing likewise as swift,\
    A monster huge, and dreadful to descrive.\
    In every plume that on her body sticks,--\
    A thing in deed much marvelous to hear,--\
    As many waker eyes lurk underneath,\
    So many mouths to speak, and listening ears.\
    By night she flies amid the cloudy sky,\
    Shrieking, by the dark shadow of the earth,\
    Ne doth decline to the sweet sleep her eyes:\
    By day she sits to mark on the house top,\
    Or turrets high, and the great towns affrays;\
    As mindful of ill and lies as blazing truth.\
\
(EARL OF SURREY: _\'c6neid_, book IV. 223-242. ab. 1540. pub. 1557.)\
\
Surrey's translation of two books of the _\'c6neid_ may have been suggested\
by the translation (1541) made by Francesco Maria Molza, attributed at\
the time to Cardinal Ippolito de Medici. This was in Italian unrimed\
verse. (See Henry Morley's _First Sketch of English Literature_, p. 294,\
and his _English Writers_, vol. viii. p. 61.) The verse of Surrey, like\
Wyatt's, shows a somewhat mechanical adherence to the syllable-counting\
principle, in contrast to regard for accents.[26] Thus we find such\
lines as:\
\
    "Each palace, and sacred porch of the gods."\
    "By the divine science of Minerva."\
\
There is a fairly free use of run-on lines; according to Schipper, 35 in\
the first 250 of the translation. Nevertheless, the general effect is\
monotonous and lacking in flexibility.\
\
    O Jove, how are these people's hearts abused!\
    What blind fury thus headlong carries them,\
    That, though so many books, so many rolls\
    Of ancient time record what grievous plagues\
    Light on these rebels aye, and though so oft\
    Their ears have heard their aged fathers tell\
    What just reward these traitors still receive,--\
    Yea, though themselves have seen deep death and blood\
    By strangling cord and slaughter of the sword\
    To such assigned, yet can they not beware,\
    Yet cannot stay their lewd rebellious hands,\
    But, suff'ring too foul reason to distain\
    Their wretched minds, forget their loyal heart,\
    Reject all truth, and rise against their prince?\
\
(SACKVILLE and NORTON: _Gorboduc, or Ferrex and Porrex_, V. ii. 1-14.\
1565.)\
\
This tragedy, although Dryden curiously instanced it in defence of the\
use of rime on the stage, was the earliest English drama in blank verse.\
The metre is decidedly more monotonous than Surrey's, and gives little\
hint of the possibilities of the measure for dramatic expression. In\
general, the early experiments in blank verse suggest--what they must\
often have seemed to their writers--the mere use of the decasyllabic\
couplet deprived of its rime. Nevertheless, as Mr. Symonds remarks of a\
passage in _Gorboduc_, "we yet may trace variety and emphasis in the\
pauses of these lines beyond what would at that epoch have been possible\
in sequences of rhymed couplets." (_Blank Verse_, p. 20.)\
\
For a specimen of the blank verse of Gascoigne's _Steel Glass_ (1576,\
the earliest didactic poem in English blank verse), see p. 18, above.\
\
    Paris, King Priam's son, thou art arraigned of partiality,\
    Of sentence partial and unjust, for that without indifferency,\
    Beyond desert or merit far, as thine accusers say,\
    From them, to Lady Venus here, thou gavest the prize away:\
    What is thine answer?\
\
_Paris's oration to the Council of the Gods:_\
\
    Sacred and just, thou great and dreadful Jove,\
    And you thrice-reverend powers, whom love nor hate\
    May wrest awry; if this, to me a man,\
    This fortune fatal be, that I must plead\
    For safe excusal of my guiltless thought,\
    The honor more makes my mishap the less,\
    That I a man must plead before the gods,\
    Gracious forbearers of the world's amiss,\
    For her, whose beauty how it hath enticed,\
    This heavenly senate may with me aver.\
\
(GEORGE PEELE: _The Arraignment of Paris_, IV. i. 61-75. 1584.)\
\
This specimen shows the new measure introduced into the drama in\
connection with the earlier rimed septenary. Peele's verse in general is\
characterized by sweetness and fluency, but there is still no hint of\
the possibilities of the unrimed decasyllabics.\
\
Schr\'f6er, in the article cited from _Anglia_, enumerates the following\
additional specimens of blank verse before the appearance of Marlowe's\
_Tamburlaine_; Grimald's _Death of Zoroas_ and _Death of Cicero_, in\
Tottel's _Songs and Sonnets_, 1557; _Jocasta_, by Gascoigne and\
Kinwelmarshe, 1566; Turberville's translation of Ovid's _Heroical\
Epistles_, 1567; Spenser's unrimed sonnets, in Van der Noodt's _Theatre\
for Worldlings_, 1569; Barnaby Rich's _Don Simonides_, 1584; parts of\
Lyly's _Woman in the Moon_, 1584; Greene's "Description of Silvestro's\
Lady," in _Morando_, 1587; _The Misfortunes of Arthur_, 1587;--the last\
two appearing probably in the same year with _Tamburlaine_, whether\
earlier or later is uncertain. Most of these specimens are short, and\
all are comparatively unimportant.\
\
    Now clear the triple region of the air,\
    And let the Majesty of Heaven behold\
    Their scourge and terror tread on emperors.\
    Smile stars, that reigned at my nativity,\
    And dim the brightness of your neighbor lamps!\
    Disdain to borrow light of Cynthia!\
    For I, the chiefest lamp of all the earth,\
    First rising in the East with mild aspect,\
    But fixed now in the Meridian line,\
    Will send up fire to your turning spheres,\
    And cause the sun to borrow light of you.\
    My sword struck fire from his coat of steel\
    Even in Bithynia, when I took this Turk;\
    As when a fiery exhalation,\
    Wrapt in the bowels of a freezing cloud\
    Fighting for passage, makes the welkin crack,\
    And casts a flash of lightning to the earth.\
\
(MARLOWE: _Tamburlaine_, Part I, IV. ii. 30-46. pub. 1590.)\
\
                          Ah, Faustus,\
    Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,\
    And then thou must be damned perpetually!\
    Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of Heaven,\
    That time may cease, and midnight never come;\
    Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make\
    Perpetual day; or let this hour be but\
    A year, a month, a week, a natural day,\
    That Faustus may repent and save his soul!\
    _O lente, lente, currite noctis equi!_\
    The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,\
    The Devil will come, and Faustus must be damned.\
    O, I'll leap up to my God! Who pulls me down?\
    See, see where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!\
    One drop would save my soul--half a drop: ah, my Christ!\
    Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ![27]\
    Yet will I call on him: O spare me, Lucifer!\
\
(MARLOWE: _Doctor Faustus_, sc. xvi. ll. 65-81. Printed 1604; written\
before 1593.)\
\
Marlowe is universally and rightly regarded as the first English poet\
who used blank verse with the hand of a master, and showed its\
possibilities. With him it became practically a new measure. Mr. Symonds\
says: "He found the ten-syllabled heroic line monotonous, monosyllabic,\
and divided into five feet of tolerably regular alternate short and\
long. He left it various in form and structure, sometimes redundant by a\
syllable, sometimes deficient, enriched with unexpected emphases and\
changes in the beat. He found no sequence or attempt at periods; one\
line succeeded another with insipid regularity, and all were made after\
the same model. He grouped his verse according to the sense, obeying an\
internal law of melody, and allowing the thought contained in his words\
to dominate their form.... Used in this fashion, blank verse became a\
Proteus. It resembled music, which requires regular time and rhythm;\
but, by the employment of phrase, induces a higher kind of melody to\
rise above the common and despotic beat of time.... It is true that,\
like all great poets, he left his own peculiar imprint on it, and that\
his metre is marked by an almost extravagant exuberance, impetuosity,\
and height of coloring." (_Blank Verse_, pp. 22-27.) In the earlier\
verse of _Tamburlaine_, while showing these new qualities of a metrical\
master, Marlowe yet kept pretty closely to the individual, end-stopped\
line; in his later verse, as illustrated in the fragmentary text of\
_Faustus_, he seems to have attained much more freedom, resembling that\
of the later plays of Shakspere.[28]\
\
    Is it mine eye, or Valentinus' praise,\
    Her true perfection, or my false transgression,\
    That makes me, reasonless, to reason thus?\
    She's fair, and so is Julia that I love,--\
    That I did love, for now my love is thawed,\
    Which, like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,\
    Bears no impression of the thing it was.\
    Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,\
    And that I love him not, as I was wont:\
    O! but I love his lady too too much;\
    And that's the reason I love him so little.\
    How shall I dote on her with more advice,\
    That thus without advice begin to love her?...\
    If I can check my erring love, I will;\
    If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, II. iv. 196-208; 213, 214. ab.\
1590.)\
\
    Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;\
    To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\
    This sensible warm motion to become\
    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\
    To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\
    In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;\
    To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,\
    And blown with restless violence about\
    The pendant world; or to be worse than worst\
    Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts\
    Imagine howling,--'tis too horrible!\
    The weariest and most loathed worldly life,\
    That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment\
    Can lay on nature, is a paradise\
    To what we fear of death.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Measure for Measure_, III. i. 118-132. ab. 1603.)\
\
This Mr. Symonds cites as "a single instance of the elasticity,\
self-restraint, and freshness of the Shaksperian blank verse; of its\
freedom from Marlowe's turgidity, or Fletcher's languor, or Milton's\
involution; of its ringing sound and lucid vigor.... It illustrates the\
freedom from adventitious ornament and the organic continuity of\
Shakspere's versification, while it also exhibits his power of varying\
his cadences and suiting them to the dramatic utterance of his\
characters." (_Blank Verse_, p. 31.)\
\
    Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;\
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot\
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets, that\
    By moonshine do the green-sour ringlets make,\
    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you, whose pastime\
    Is to make midnight mushrooms; that rejoice\
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid\
    (Weak masters though ye be) I have bedimm'd\
    The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,\
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault\
    Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\
    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak\
    With his own bolt: the strong-bas'd promontory\
    Have I made shake; and by the spurs pluck'd up\
    The pine and cedar: graves, at my command,\
    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let them forth\
    By my so potent art.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _The Tempest_, V. i. 33-50. ab. 1610.)\
\
No attempt can be made to represent adequately the blank verse of\
Shakspere. The specimens, chosen respectively from his earlier, middle,\
and later periods, illustrate the trend of development of his verse. In\
the earlier period it was characterized by the slight use of feminine\
endings and _enjambement_; in the later by marked preference for both,\
and by general freedom and flexibility. In other words, Shakspere's own\
development represents, in a sort of miniature, that of the history of\
dramatic blank verse. According to Furnivall's tables, the proportion of\
run-on lines to end-stopped lines in _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ is\
one in ten, while in _The Tempest_ it is one in three. The increased use\
of "light" and "weak" endings is closely analogous. Professor Wendell\
says of the verse of _Cymbeline_: "End-stopped lines are so deliberately\
avoided that one feels a sense of relief when a speech and a line end\
together. Such a phrase as\
\
    'How slow his soul sail'd on, how swift his ship'\
\
is deliberately made, not a single line, but two half-lines. Several\
times, in the broken dialogue, one has literally to count the syllables\
before the metrical regularity of the verse appears.... Clearly this\
puzzling style is decadent; the distinction between verse and prose is\
breaking down." (_William Shakspere_, p. 357.)[29]\
\
                                  I, that did help\
    To fell the lofty cedar of the world\
    Germanicus; that at one stroke cut down\
    Drusus, that upright elm; withered his vine;\
    Laid Silius and Sabinus, two strong oaks,\
    Flat on the earth; besides those other shrubs,\
    Cordus and Sosia, Claudia Pulchra,\
    Furnius and Gallus, which I have grubbed up;\
    And since, have set my axe so strong and deep\
    Into the root of spreading Agrippine;\
    Lopt off and scattered her proud branches, Nero,\
    Drusus; and Caius too, although replanted.\
    If you will, Destinies, that after all,\
    I faint now ere I touch my period,\
    You are but cruel; and I already have done\
    Things great enough. All Rome hath been my slave;\
    The senate sate an idle looker-on,\
    And witness of my power; when I have blushed\
    More to command than it to suffer: all\
    The fathers have sat ready and prepared,\
    To give me empire, temples, or their throats,\
    When I would ask 'em; and, what crowns the top,\
    Rome, senate, people, all the world have seen\
    Jove but my equal; C\'e6sar but my second.\
    'Tis then your malice, Fates, who, but your own,\
    Envy and fear to have any power long known.\
\
(BEN JONSON: _Sejanus_, V. iv. 1603.)\
\
Jonson's blank verse, says Mr. Symonds, is that "of a scholar--pointed,\
polished, and free from the lyricisms of his age. It lacks harmony and\
is often labored; but vigorous and solid it never fails to be." He also\
instances the opening lines of the _Sad Shepherd_ as exceptional in\
their "delicate music." Beaumont's verse is in many ways similar in\
structure to Jonson's, yet commonly more melodious.\
\
                                  "He is all\
    (As he stands now) but the mere name of C\'e6sar,\
    And should the Emperor enforce him lesser,\
    Not coming from himself, it were more dangerous:\
    He is honest, and will hear you. Doubts are scattered,\
    And almost come to growth in every household;\
    Yet, in my foolish judgment, were this mastered,\
    The people, that are now but rage, and his,\
    Might be again obedience. You shall know me\
    When Rome is fair again; till when, I love you."\
    No name! This may be cunning; yet it seems not,\
    For there is nothing in it but is certain,\
    Besides my safety. Had not good Germanicus,\
    That was as loyal and as straight as he is,\
    If not prevented by Tiberius,\
    Been by the soldiers forced their emperor?\
    He had, and 'tis my wisdom to remember it:\
    And was not Corbulo (even that Corbulo,\
    That ever fortunate and living Roman,\
    That broke the heart-strings of the Parthians,\
    And brought Arsaces' line upon their knees,\
    Chained to the awe of Rome), because he was thought\
    (And but in wine once) fit to make a C\'e6sar,\
    Cut off by Nero? I must seek my safety;\
    For 'tis the same again, if not beyond it.\
\
(FLETCHER: _Valentinian_, IV. i. ab. 1615.)\
\
                   I can but grieve my ignorance:\
    Repentance, some say too, is the best sacrifice;\
    For sure, sir, if my chance had been so happy\
    (As I confess I was mine own destroyer)\
    As to have arrived at you, I will not prophesy,\
    But certain, as I think, I should have pleased you;\
    Have made you as much wonder at my courtesy,\
    My love and duty, as I have disheartened you.\
    Some hours we have of youth, and some of folly;\
    And being free-born maids, we take a liberty,\
    And, to maintain that, sometimes we strain highly....\
    A sullen woman fear, that talks not to you;\
    She has a sad and darkened soul, loves dully;\
    A merry and a free wench, give her liberty,\
    Believe her, in the lightest form she appears to you,\
    Believe her excellent, though she despise you;\
    Let but these fits and flashes pass, she will show to you\
    As jewels rubbed from dust, or gold new burnished.\
\
(FLETCHER: _The Wild-Goose Chase_, IV. i. 1621.)\
\
The verse of Fletcher is highly individual among the Jacobean\
dramatists, though in a sense typical of the breaking down of blank\
verse, in the direction of prose, which was going on at this period. The\
distinguishing feature of Fletcher's verse is the constant use of\
feminine endings, and the extension of these to triple and even\
quadruple endings, by the addition of one or more syllables.\
Twelve-syllable lines (not alexandrines, but ordinary lines with triple\
endings) are not at all uncommon; and the additional syllable or\
syllables may even be emphatic. In general the tendency was in the\
direction of the freedom of conversational prose. Such a line as\
\
    "Methinks you are infinitely bound to her for her journey"\
\
would not be recognized, standing by itself, as a five-stress iambic\
verse; properly read, however, it takes its place without difficulty in\
the scheme of the metre.[30]\
\
    Whatever ails me, now a-late especially,\
    I can as well be hanged as refrain seeing her;\
    Some twenty times a day, nay, not so little,\
    Do I force errands, frame ways and excuses,\
    To come into her sight; and I've small reason for't,\
    And less encouragement, for she baits me still\
    Every time worse than other; does profess herself\
    The cruellest enemy to my face in town;\
    At no hand can abide the sight of me,\
    As if danger or ill luck hung in my looks.\
    I must confess my face is bad enough,\
    But I know far worse has better fortune,\
    And not endur'd alone, but doted on;\
    And yet such pick-hair'd faces, chins like witches',\
    Here and there five hairs whispering in a corner,\
    As if they grew in fear of one another,\
    Wrinkles like troughs, where swine-deformity swills\
    The tears of perjury, that lie there like wash\
    Fallen from the slimy and dishonest eye;\
    Yet such a one plucks sweets without restraint.\
\
(THOMAS MIDDLETON: _The Changeling_, II. i. ab. 1623.)\
\
Middleton carried on the work of fitting blank verse for plausibly\
conversational, as distinguished from poetic, effects. Often his lines\
are more difficult to scan than Fletcher's, and still less seek\
melodiousness for its own sake. Characteristic specimens are verses like\
these:\
\
    "I doubt I'm too quick of apprehension now."\
    "With which one gentleman, far in debt, has courted her."\
    "To call for, 'fore me, and thou look'st half ill indeed."\
\
    What would it pleasure me to have my throat cut\
    With diamonds? or to be smothered\
    With cassia? or to be shot to death with pearls?\
    I know death hath ten thousand several doors\
    For men to take their exits; and 'tis found\
    They go on such strange geometrical hinges,\
    You may open them both ways; any way, for Heaven sake,\
    So I were out of your whispering. Tell my brothers\
    That I perceive death, now I am well awake,\
    Best gift is they can give or I can take....\
    --Pull, and pull strongly, for your able strength\
    Must pull down Heaven upon me:--\
    Yet stay; Heaven-gates are not so highly arched\
    As princes' palaces; they that enter there\
    Must go upon their knees.--Come, violent death,\
    Serve for mandragora to make me sleep!--\
    Go tell my brothers, when I am laid out,\
    They then may feed in quiet.\
\
(JOHN WEBSTER: _The Duchess of Malfi_, IV. ii. 1623.)\
\
"Webster," says Mr. Symonds, "used his metre as the most delicate and\
responsive instrument for all varieties of dramatic expression....\
Scansion in the verse of Webster is subordinate to the purpose of the\
speaker." (_Blank Verse_, pp. 45-47.) He also calls attention to such\
remarkable lines as--\
\
    "Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young."\
    "Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out."\
\
    Are you not frightened with the imprecations\
    And curses of whole families, made wretched\
    By your sinister practices?--\
                                  --Yes, as rocks are,\
    When foamy billows split themselves against\
    Their flinty ribs; or as the moon is moved,\
    When wolves, with hunger pined, howl at her brightness.\
    I am of a solid temper, and, like these,\
    Steer on, a constant course: with mine own sword,\
    If called into the field, I can make that right\
    Which fearful enemies murmured at as wrong.\
    Now, for these other piddling complaints\
    Breathed out in bitterness; as when they call me\
    Extortioner, tyrant, cormorant, or intruder\
    On my poor neighbor's right, or grand incloser\
    Of what was common, to my private use;\
    Nay, when my ears are pierced with widows' cries,\
    And undone orphans wash with tears my threshold,\
    I only think what 'tis to have my daughter\
    Right honorable; and 'tis a powerful charm\
    Makes me insensible of remorse, or pity,\
    Or the least sting of conscience.\
\
(PHILIP MASSINGER: _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_, IV. i. 1633.)\
\
Massinger's verse is more regular than that of Fletcher and others, in\
the matter of extra final syllables and the like, but free and flexible\
in the use of run-on lines and generally progressive movement.[31] It is\
an error to assume that there was no good blank verse written in this\
period when the drama in general is said to have been in a state of\
"decadence." The verse of Ford, for example, is noticeably strong and\
restrained (compare the remark of Mr. Symonds, on its "glittering\
regularity"). On the other hand, one may see the dramas of Richard Brome\
for specimens of the decadent metre at its worst. Brome wrote comedies\
both in prose and verse, and there is little difference between the two\
forms in his hands. See also the crude and lax verse of some of the\
early plays of Dryden, illustrated on p. 234 below. It was verse of this\
kind which, as Mr. Gosse observes, justified the introduction of the\
heroic couplet in all its strictness.\
\
    All in a moment through the gloom were seen\
    Ten thousand banners rise into the air\
    With orient colors waving: with them rose\
    A forest huge of spears: and thronging helms\
    Appear'd, and serried shields in thick array\
    Of depth immeasurable: anon they move\
    In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood\
    Of flutes and soft recorders; such as rais'd\
    To height of noblest temper heroes old\
    Arming to battle, and in stead of rage\
    Deliberate valor breath'd, firm and unmov'd\
    With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\
    Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage\
    With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase\
    Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\
    From mortal or immortal minds....\
                           ... And now his heart\
    Distends with pride, and hardening in his strength\
    Glories: for never since created man\
    Met such embodied force, as nam'd with these\
    Could merit more than that small infantry\
    Warr'd on by cranes: though all the giant brood\
    Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined\
    That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side\
    Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds\
    In fable or romance of Uther's son\
    Begirt with British and Armoric knights;\
    And all who since, baptiz'd or infidel,\
    Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,\
    Damasco, or Morocco, or Trebizond,\
    Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore\
    When Charlemagne with all his peerage fell\
    By Fontarabbia.\
\
(MILTON: _Paradise Lost_, Book I. ll. 544-559; 571-587. 1667.)\
\
                     With head a while inclined,\
    And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,\
    Or some great matter in his mind revolved:\
    At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:--\
    "Hitherto, Lords, what your commands imposed\
    I have performed, as reason was, obeying,\
    Not without wonder or delight beheld;\
    Now, of my own accord, such other trial\
    I mean to show you of my strength, yet greater,\
    As with amaze shall strike all who behold."\
    This uttered, straining all his nerves he bowed;\
    As with the force of winds and waters pent\
    When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars,\
    With horrible convulsion to and fro\
    He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew\
    The whole roof after them with burst of thunder\
    Upon the heads of all who sat beneath.\
\
(MILTON: _Samson Agonistes_, ll. 1636-1652. 1671.)\
\
The blank verse of Milton is characterized by greater freedom and\
flexibility than that of any earlier poet. The single line practically\
ceases to be the unit of the verse, which is divided rather into\
metrical paragraphs, or, as some would even call them, stanzas.\
Professor Corson quotes an interesting passage from a letter of\
Coleridge, giving an account of a conversation in which Wordsworth\
expressed his view of this sort of blank verse. "My friend gave his\
definition and notion of harmonious verse, that it consisted (the\
English iambic blank verse above all) in the apt arrangement of pauses\
and cadences, and the sweep of whole paragraphs,\
\
             with many a winding bout\
    Of linked sweetness long drawn out,\
\
and not in the even flow, much less in the prominence or antithetic\
vigor of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total effect,\
except where they were introduced for some specific purpose." (Corson's\
_Primer of English Verse_, p. 218.) In like manner Mr. Symonds says:\
"The most sonorous passages begin and end with interrupted lines,\
including in one organic structure, periods, parentheses, and paragraphs\
of fluent melody.... In these structures there are many pauses which\
enable the ear and voice to rest themselves, but none are perfect, none\
satisfy the want created by the opening hemistich, until the final and\
deliberate close is reached." (_Blank Verse_ pp. 56, 57.)\
\
In Milton's own prefatory note to _Paradise Lost_, he called his blank\
verse "English heroic verse without rime." Rime he spoke of as "the\
invention of a barbarous age, ... graced indeed since by the use of some\
famous modern poets,"--not least among them, he might have said, being\
John Milton himself. He described also the special character of his\
verse in saying that "true musical delight ... consists only in apt\
numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out\
from one verse into another,"--that is, by _enjambement_. "This neglect\
then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect, ... that it rather\
is to be esteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient\
liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage\
of riming."[32]\
\
It appears from this note that Milton regarded his heroic blank verse as\
a different measure from the familiar dramatic blank verse. The latter\
he used in _Samson Agonistes_, the verse-structure of which will be seen\
to differ from that of _Paradise Lost_; the most salient distinction is\
the more frequent use of feminine endings. Mr. Symonds remarks\
interestingly on the "difference between Shaksperian and Miltonic,\
between dramatic and epical blank verse. The one is simple in\
construction and progressive, the other is complex and stationary....\
The one exhibits a thought, in the process of formation, developing\
itself from the excited fancy of the speaker. The other presents to us\
an image crystallized and perfect in the poet's mind; the one is in\
time, the other in space--the one is a growing and the other a complete\
organism.... The one, if we may play upon a fancy, resembles Music, and\
the other Architecture." (_Blank Verse_, p. 58.)\
\
                 Methinks I do not want\
    That huge long train of fawning followers,\
    That swept a furlong after me.\
    'Tis true I am alone;\
    So was the godhead, ere he made the world,\
    And better served himself than served by nature.\
    And yet I have a soul\
    Above this humble fate. I could command,\
    Love to do good, give largely to true merit,\
    All that a king should do; but though these are not\
    My province, I have scene enough within\
    To exercise my virtue.\
    All that a heart, so fixed as mine, can move,\
    Is, that my niggard fortune starves my love.\
\
(DRYDEN: _Marriage \'e0 la Mode_, III. i. 1672.)\
\
    She lay, and leaned her cheek upon her hand,\
    And cast a look so languishingly sweet,\
    As if, secure of all beholders' hearts,\
    Neglecting, she could take them: boys, like Cupids,\
    Stood fanning, with their painted wings, the winds\
    That played about her face: but if she smiled,\
    A darting glory seemed to blaze abroad,\
    That men's desiring eyes were never wearied,\
    But hung upon the object. To soft flutes\
    The silver oars kept time; and while they played,\
    The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight,\
    And both to thought. 'Twas heaven, or somewhat more;\
\
(DRYDEN: _All for Love_, III. i. 1678.)\
\
The first of these specimens of Dryden's blank verse illustrates the\
loose form of it found in many of the comedies, ill distinguished from\
prose and used interchangeably with prose, as in the case of the late\
Jacobean dramatists. It was with _All for Love_ that Dryden dropped the\
use of the rimed couplet in tragedy, and turned his hand toward the\
construction of really noble blank verse. This play was professedly an\
imitation of Shakspere, and the passage here quoted is a paraphrase of\
one in _Antony and Cleopatra_, II. ii. Shakspere's blank verse doubtless\
exerted a good influence on the quality of Dryden's. "From this time\
on," says Mr. Gosse, "Dryden's blank verse was more severe than any\
which had been used, except by Milton, since Ben Jonson." (_Eighteenth\
Century Literature_, p. 14.)\
\
            Then hear me, bounteous Heaven!\
    Pour down your blessings on this beauteous head,\
    Where everlasting sweets are always springing:\
    With a continual-giving hand, let peace,\
    Honor, and safety always hover round her;\
    Feed her with plenty; let her eyes ne'er see\
    A sight of sorrow, nor her heart know mourning:\
    Crown all her days with joy, her nights with rest\
    Harmless as her own thoughts, and prop her virtue\
    To bear the loss of one that too much loved;\
    And comfort her with patience in our parting....\
                  --Then hear me too, just Heaven!\
    Pour down your curses on this wretched head,\
    With never-ceasing vengeance; let despair,\
    Danger, or infamy, nay, all surround me.\
    Starve me with wantings; let my eyes ne'er see\
    A sight of comfort, nor my heart know peace;\
    But dash my days with sorrow, nights with horrors\
    Wild as my own thoughts now, and let loose fury\
    To make me mad enough for what I lose,\
    If I must lose him--if I must! I will not.\
\
(THOMAS OTWAY: _Venice Preserved_, V. ii. 1682.)\
\
This play was one of those marking the return of the serious drama to\
blank verse, after the brief domination of the couplet on the stage.\
While Otway's verse is not as good as Dryden's best, it is of fairly\
even merit, and shows that something had been learned from the practice\
of the couplet.\
\
    Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!\
    Through what variety of untried being,\
    Through what new scenes and changes must we pass!\
    The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;\
    But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.\
    Here will I hold. If there's a power above us\
    (And that there is all nature cries aloud\
    Through all her works), he must delight in virtue;\
    And that which he delights in must be happy....\
    ... The soul, secured in her existence, smiles\
    At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.\
    The stars shall fade away, the sun himself\
    Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years,\
    But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,\
    Unhurt amidst the wars of elements,\
    The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.\
\
(ADDISON: _Cato_, V. i. ll. 10-18; 25-31. 1713.)\
\
    Tell us, ye dead! will none of you, in pity\
    To those you left behind, disclose the secret?\
    Oh! that some courteous ghost would blab it out,--\
    What 'tis you are, and we must shortly be.\
    I've heard that souls departed have sometimes\
    Forewarn'd men of their death. 'Twas kindly done\
    To knock, and give the alarum. But what means\
    This stinted charity? 'Tis but lame kindness\
    That does its work by halves. Why might you not\
    Tell us what 'tis to die? Do the strict laws\
    Of your society forbid your speaking\
    Upon a point so nice? I'll ask no more:\
    Sullen, like lamps in sepulchres, your shine\
    Enlightens but yourselves. Well, 'tis no matter;\
    A very little time will clear up all\
    And make us learn'd as you are, and as close.\
\
(ROBERT BLAIR: _The Grave_. 1743.)\
\
This poem was one of those connected with the revival of blank verse,\
for didactic poetry, near the middle of the eighteenth century. Of\
Blair's verse Mr. Saintsbury says that it "is by no means to be\
despised. Technically its only fault is the use and abuse of the\
redundant syllable. The quality ... is in every respect rather moulded\
upon dramatic than upon purely poetical models, and he shows little\
trace of imitation either of Milton, or of his contemporary, Thomson."\
(Ward's _English Poets_, vol. iii. p. 217.)\
\
    Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,\
    At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes\
    Fall broad, and wide, and fast, dimming the day\
    With a continual flow. The cherished fields\
    Put on their winter-robe of purest white.\
    'Tis brightness all; save where the new snow melts\
    Along the mazy current. Low the woods\
    Bow their hoar head; and, ere the languid sun\
    Faint from the west emits his evening ray,\
    Earth's universal face, deep-hid and chill,\
    Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide\
    The works of man. Drooping, the laborer-ox\
    Stands covered o'er with snow, and then demands\
    The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,\
    Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around\
    The winnowing store, and claim the little boon\
    Which Providence assigns them. One alone,\
    The redbreast, sacred to the household gods,\
    Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,\
    In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves\
    His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man\
    His annual visit. Half-afraid, he first\
    Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights\
    On the warm hearth; then, hopping o'er the floor,\
    Eyes all the smiling family askance,\
    And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is--\
    Till, more familiar grown, the table-crumbs\
    Attract his slender feet.\
\
(THOMSON: _The Seasons; Winter_. 1726.)\
\
Thomson's _Seasons_ was undoubtedly the most influential of the poems of\
the blank-verse revival of this period. Saintsbury says: "His blank\
verse in especial cannot receive too much commendation. With that of\
Milton, and that of the present Poet Laureate [Tennyson], it must rank\
as one of the chief original models of the metre to be found in English\
poetry." (Ward's _English Poets_, vol. iii. p. 169.)\
\
Other influential poems of the same period, written in blank verse, were\
Glover's _Leonidas_ (1737), Young's _Night Thoughts_ (1742-1744), and\
Akenside's _Pleasures of the Imagination_ (1744). Much earlier than\
these had come the curious poem of John Philips on _Cider_ (1708).\
Philips is praised by Thomson as the successor of Milton in some lines\
of _Autumn_:\
\
    "Philips, Pomona's bard, the second thou\
    Who nobly durst, in rhyme-unfetter'd verse\
    With British freedom sing the British song."\
\
In general, the blank verse of all these poets shows the influence of\
the couplet and lacks flexibility. Thus Mr. Symonds says: "The use of\
the couplet had unfitted poets for its composition. Their acquired\
canons of regularity, when applied to loose and flowing metre, led them\
astray.... Hence it followed, that when blank verse began again to be\
written, it found itself very much at the point where it had stood\
before the appearance of Marlowe. Even Thomson ... wrote stiff and\
languid blank verse with monosyllabic terminations and monotonous\
cadences--a pedestrian style." (_Blank Verse_, pp. 61, 62.)[33]\
\
    Here unmolested, through whatever sign\
    The sun proceeds, I wander; neither mist,\
    Nor freezing sky nor sultry, checking me,\
    Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy.\
    Even in the spring and playtime of the year,\
    That calls the unwonted villager abroad\
    With all her little ones, a sportive train,\
    To gather kingcups in the yellow mead,\
    And prink their hair with daisies, or to pick\
    A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook,\
    These shades are all my own. The timorous hare,\
    Grown so familiar with her frequent guest,\
    Scarce shuns me; and the stockdove unalarmed\
    Sits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends\
    His long love-ditty for my near approach.\
    Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm\
    That age or injury has hollowed deep,\
    Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves\
    He has outslept the winter, ventures forth\
    To frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,\
    The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.\
    He sees me, and at once, swift as a bird,\
    Ascends the neighboring beech; there whisks his brush,\
    And perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,\
    With all the prettiness of feigned alarm,\
    And anger insignificantly fierce.\
\
(COWPER: _The Task_, book VI. ll. 295-320. 1785.)\
\
"The blank verse of Cowper's _Task_ is admirably adapted to the theme,"\
says Professor Corson. "Cowper saw farther than any one before him had\
seen, into the secrets of the elaborate music of Milton's blank verse,\
and availed himself of those secrets to some extent--to as far an extent\
as the simplicity of his themes demanded." (_Primer of English Verse_,\
p. 221.) Professor Ward speaks, however, of the "lumbering movement" of\
Cowper's blank verse as being in contrast to "the neatness and ease of\
his rhymed couplets." (_English Poets_, vol. iii. p. 432.) Cowper prided\
himself, not without reason, on the individuality of his blank verse. In\
a letter to the Rev. John Newton (Dec. 11, 1784) he said: "Milton's\
manner was peculiar. So is Thomson's. He that should write like either\
of them, would, in my judgment, deserve the name of a copyist, but not\
of a poet.... Blank verse is susceptible of a much greater\
diversification of manner than verse in rhyme: and why the modern\
writers of it have all thought proper to cast their numbers alike, I\
know not." In another letter (to Lady Hesketh, March 20, 1786) Cowper\
reveals his careful study of Milton's verse: "When the sense requires\
it, or when for the sake of avoiding a monotonous cadence of the lines,\
of which there is always danger in so long a work, it shall appear to be\
prudent, I still leave a verse behind me that has some uneasiness in its\
formation. It is not possible to read _Paradise Lost_, with an ear for\
harmony, without being sensible of the great advantage which Milton drew\
from such a management.... Uncritical readers find that they perform a\
long journey through several hundred pages perhaps without weariness;\
they find the numbers harmonious, but are not aware of the art by which\
that harmony is brought to pass, much less suspect that a violation of\
all harmony on some occasions is the very thing to which they are not a\
little indebted for their gratification."\
\
    Thou too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,\
    Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,\
    Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene\
    Into the depth of clouds, that veil thy breast--\
    Thou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou\
    That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low\
    In adoration, upward from thy base\
    Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears,\
    Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,\
    To rise before me--Rise, O ever rise,\
    Rise like a cloud of incense from the earth!\
    Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills,\
    Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven,\
    Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,\
    And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,\
    Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God.\
\
(COLERIDGE: _Hymn before Sunrise, in the Vale of Chamouni_, ll. 70-85.\
1802.)\
\
    It was a den where no insulting light\
    Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans\
    They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar\
    Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,\
    Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.\
    Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd\
    Ever as if just rising from a sleep,\
    Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;\
    And thus in thousand hugest phantasies\
    Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.\
    Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,\
    Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge\
    Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:\
    Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.\
    C\'9cus, and Gyges, and Briareus,\
    Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,\
    With many more, the brawniest in assault,\
    Were pent in regions of laborious breath;\
    Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep\
    Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs\
    Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;\
    Without a motion, save of their big hearts\
    Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd\
    With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.\
\
(KEATS: _Hyperion_, book II. 1820.)\
\
"In Keats at last," says Mr. Symonds, "we find again that inner music\
which is the soul of true blank verse.... His _Hyperion_ is sung, not\
written.... Its music is fluid, bound by no external measurement of\
feet, but determined by the sense and intonation of the poet's thought,\
while like the crotalos of the Athenian flute-player, the decasyllabic\
beat maintains an uninterrupted undercurrent of regular pulsations."\
(_Blank Verse_, p. 64.)\
\
                              I have learned\
    To look on nature, not as in the hour\
    Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\
    The still, sad music of humanity,\
    Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\
    To chasten and subdue. And I have felt\
    A presence that disturbs me with the joy\
    Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\
    Of something far more deeply interfused,\
    Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\
    And the round ocean and the living air,\
    And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:\
    A motion and a spirit, that impels\
    All thinking things, all objects of all thought,\
    And rolls through all things.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _Lines Composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey_. 1798.)\
\
    Let not high verse, mourning the memory\
    Of that which is no more, or painting's woe\
    Or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery\
    Their own cold powers. Art and eloquence,\
    And all the shows o' the world, are frail and vain\
    To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade.\
    It is a woe 'too deep for tears,' when all\
    Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,\
    Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves\
    Those who remain behind, not sobs or groans,\
    The passionate tumult of a clinging hope;\
    But pale despair and cold tranquillity,\
    Nature's vast frame, the web of human things,\
    Birth and the grave, that are not as they were.\
\
(SHELLEY: _Alastor_, ll. 707-720. 1815.)\
\
    The old order changeth, yielding place to new,\
    And God fulfils himself in many ways,\
    Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.\
    Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?\
    I have lived my life, and that which I have done\
    May He within himself make pure! but thou,\
    If thou shouldst never see my face again,\
    Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer\
    Than this world dreams of. Wherefore let thy voice\
    Rise like a fountain for me night and day.\
    For what are men better than sheep or goats\
    That nourish a blind life within the brain,\
    If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer\
    Both for themselves and those who call them friend?\
    For so the whole round earth is every way\
    Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.\
    But now farewell. I am going a long way\
    With these thou seest--if indeed I go\
    (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--\
    To the island-valley of Avilion;\
    Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,\
    Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies\
    Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns\
    And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,\
    Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Idylls of the King; The Passing of Arthur_. 1869.)\
\
                           But that large-moulded man,\
    His visage all agrin as at a wake,\
    Made at me thro' the press, and, staggering back\
    With stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came\
    As comes a pillar of electric cloud,\
    Flaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,\
    And shadowing down the champaign till it strikes\
    On a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,\
    And twists the grain with such a roar that Earth\
    Reels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything\
    Gave way before him: only Florian, he\
    That loved me closer than his own right eye,\
    Thrust in between; but Arac rode him down:\
    And Cyril seeing it, push'd against the Prince,\
    With Psyche's color round his helmet, tough,\
    Strong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;\
    But tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote\
    And threw him: last I spurr'd; I felt my veins\
    Stretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,\
    And sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,\
    Till I struck out and shouted; the blade glanc'd;\
    I did but shear a feather, and dream and truth\
    Flow'd from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.\
\
(TENNYSON: _The Princess_, v. 1847.)\
\
    She knew me, and acknowledg'd me her heir,\
    Pray'd me to keep her debts, and keep the Faith;\
    Then claspt the cross, and pass'd away in peace.\
    I left her lying still and beautiful,\
    More beautiful than in life. Why would you vex yourself,\
    Poor sister? Sir, I swear I have no heart\
    To be your queen. To reign is restless fence,\
    Tierce, quart, and trickery. Peace is with the dead.\
    Her life was winter, for her spring was nipt;\
    And she loved much: pray God she be forgiven.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Queen Mary_, V. v. 1875.)\
\
    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\
    That brings our friends up from the underworld,\
    Sad as the last which reddens over one\
    That sinks with all we love below the verge;\
    So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\
\
    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\
    The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\
    To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\
    The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\
    So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\
\
(TENNYSON: _The Princess_, iv.; "Tears, Idle Tears." 1847.)\
\
The blank verse of Tennyson is probably to be regarded as the most\
masterly found among modern poets.[34] Its flexibility is almost\
infinite, yet never unmelodious. The last of the specimens just quoted\
illustrates his use of blank verse for short lyrical poems,--an unusual\
and notable achievement. Perhaps only Collins's _Ode to Evening_ can be\
compared with his success in this direction, and Collins used a more\
elaborate strophe to fill, in part, the place of rime. Of the unrimed\
lyrics in _The Princess_, Mr. Symonds says that they "are perfect\
specimens of most melodious and complete minstrelsy in words." In the\
"Tears, Idle Tears," he goes on to say, the verse "is divided into\
periods of five lines, each of which terminates with the words 'days\
that are no more.' This recurrence of sound and meaning is a substitute\
for rhyme, and suggests rhyme so persuasively that it is impossible to\
call the poem mere blank verse." See also the specimens on p. 144 above.\
\
In the case of both Tennyson and Browning the student should compare the\
form of the narrative blank verse on the one hand with that of the\
dramatic on the other. Yet in a sense all Browning's blank verse is\
dramatic. It is no less flexible than Tennyson's, but (as in most of\
Browning's poetry) sacrifices more of melody in adapting itself to the\
thought.\
\
    To live, and see her learn, and learn by her,\
    Out of the low obscure and petty world--\
    Or only see one purpose and one will\
    Evolve themselves i' the world, change wrong to right:\
    To have to do with nothing but the true,\
    The good, the eternal--and these, not alone,\
    In the main current of the general life,\
    But small experiences of every day,\
    Concerns of the particular hearth and home:\
    To learn not only by a comet's rush\
    But a rose's birth,--not by the grandeur, God,\
    But the comfort, Christ. All this, how far away!\
    Mere delectation, meet for a minute's dream!--\
    Just as a drudging student trims his lamp,\
    Opens his Plutarch, puts him in the place\
    Of Roman, Grecian; draws the patch'd gown close,\
    Dreams, "Thus should I fight, save or rule the world!"\
    Then smilingly, contentedly, awakes\
    To the old solitary nothingness.\
    So I, from such communion, pass content.--\
    O great, just, good God! Miserable me!\
\
(BROWNING: _The Ring and the Book; Caponsacchi_. 1868.)\
\
_The Ring and the Book_ Professor Corson calls "the greatest achievement\
of the century ... in the effective use of blank verse in the treatment\
of a great subject.... Its blank verse, while having a most complex\
variety of character, is the most dramatic blank verse since the\
Elizabethan era.... One reads it without a sense almost of there being\
anything artificial in the construction of the language; ... one gets\
the impression that the poet thought and felt spontaneously in blank\
verse." (_Primer of English Verse_, pp. 224, 225.)\
\
                          This eve's the time,\
    This eve intense with yon first trembling star\
    We seem to pant and reach; scarce aught between\
    The earth that rises and the heaven that bends;\
    All nature self-abandoned, every tree\
    Flung as it will, pursuing its own thoughts\
    And fixed so, every flower and every weed,\
    No pride, no shame, no victory, no defeat;\
    All under God, each measured by itself.\
    These statues round us stand abrupt, distinct,\
    The strong in strength, the weak in weakness fixed,\
    The Muse forever wedded to her lyre,\
    Nymph to her fawn, and Silence to her rose:\
    See God's approval on his universe!\
    Let us do so--aspire to live as these\
    In harmony with truth, ourselves being true!\
    Take the first way, and let the second come!\
\
(BROWNING: _In a Balcony_. 1855.)\
\
    The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?\
    So, the All-Great were the All-Loving too--\
    So, through the thunder comes a human voice\
    Saying, "O heart I made, a heart beats here!\
    Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!\
    Thou hast no power nor may'st conceive of mine,\
    But love I gave thee, with myself to love,\
    And thou must love me who have died for thee."\
    The madman saith He said so: it is strange.\
\
(BROWNING: _Epistle of Karshish_. 1855.)\
\
    God's works--paint any one, and count it crime\
    To let a truth slip. Don't object, "His works\
    Are here already; nature is complete:\
    Suppose you reproduce her--(which you can't)\
    There's no advantage! you must beat her, then."\
    For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love\
    First when we see them painted, things we have passed\
    Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;\
    And so they are better, painted--better to us,\
    Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;\
    God uses us to help each other so,\
    Lending our minds out.\
\
(BROWNING: _Fra Lippo Lippi_. 1855.)\
\
Of some of Browning's blank verse Mr. Mayor observes: "The extreme\
harshness of many of these lines is almost a match for anything in\
Surrey, only what in Surrey is helplessness seems the perversity of\
strength in Browning.... The Aristophanic vein in Browning is\
continually leading him to trample under foot the dignity of verse and\
to shock the uninitiated reader by colloquial familiarities, 'thumps\
upon the back,' such as the poet Cowper resented; yet no one can be more\
impressive than he is when he surrenders himself to the pure spirit of\
poetry, and flows onward in a stream of glorious music, such as that in\
which Balaustion pictures Athens overwhelmed by an advance of the sea\
(_Aristophanes' Apology_, p. 2)." (_Chapters on English Metre_, 2d ed.,\
pp. 216, 217.)\
\
    But the majestic river floated on,\
    Out of the mist and hum of that low land,\
    Into the frosty starlight, and there mov'd,\
    Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,\
    Under the solitary moon: he flow'd\
    Right for the Polar Star, past Orgunje,\
    Brimming, and bright, and large: then sands begin\
    To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,\
    And split his currents; that for many a league\
    The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along\
    Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles--\
    Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had\
    In his high mountain cradle in Pamere,\
    A foil'd, circuitous wanderer:--till at last\
    The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide\
    His luminous home of waters opens, bright\
    And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bath'd stars\
    Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.\

\
(STEPHEN PHILLIPS: _Paolo and Francesca_, III. iii. 1901.)\
\
The blank verse of Stephen Phillips is the most important--one may say\
perhaps the only important--that has been written since Tennyson's; and\
it is of especial interest as forming an actual revival of the form on\
the English stage. Aside from the dramas, it is seen at its best in\
_Marpessa_. Imitating Milton, and at the same time handling the measure\
with original force, Mr. Phillips introduces unusual cadences, for which\
he has been severely reproached by the critics. Such lines as the\
following are typical of these variations from the normal rhythm:\
\
    "O all fresh out of beautiful sunlight."\
    "Agamemnon bowed over, and from his wheel."\
    "And to dispel shadows and shadowy fear."\
    "My bloom faded, and waning light of eyes."\
\
For a criticism of Mr. Phillips's verse, see Mr. William Archer's _Poets\
of the Younger Generation_, pp. 313-327.\
\
\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[19] One may easily find other instances of the sporadic appearance of\
the same measure in the midst of irregular "long lines" or rough\
alexandrines and septenaries. Compare, for example, the following, from\
early plays in Manly's _Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama_:\
\
"To be alone, nor very convenyent." "Ye shall not touche yt, for that I\
forbede." "But ye shuld be as godes resydent." "And many a chaumbyr thou\
xalt have therinne." "In this flood spylt is many a mannys blood."\
"Therfore be we now cast in ryght grett care."\
\
The context of many of these lines shows that they were intended to be\
read as four-stress rather than five-stress; but such examples serve to\
make clear how easily English rhythm would fall into the decasyllabic\
line.\

the avoidance of rime on weak syllables, the preservation of the accent\
on the even-numbered syllables. (To some of these reforms, as has been\
indicated, there are not a few exceptions.) In like manner ten Brink\
observes that Surrey "is more successful than Wyatt in adapting foreign\

test of authorship. Mr. Macaulay also remarks interestingly that\
Fletcher's metrical style is an outgrowth of his general use of the\
loose or disjointed, as opposed to the periodic or rounded, style of\

On the other hand, there were not wanting protestants against the form,\

\
III. SIX-STRESS AND SEVEN-STRESS VERSE\
\
\
A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER)\
\
The alexandrine was introduced into English from French verse, as early\
(according to Schipper) as the early part of the thirteenth century.\
Early poems in this metre alone, however, are almost wholly wanting, if\
they ever existed. The early alexandrines usually appear in conjunction\
with the septenary (seven-stress verse). The French alexandrine has\
almost always been characterized by a regular and strongly marked medial\
cesura, and this very commonly appears in the English form, but by no\
means universally.\
\
The French alexandrine is of uncertain origin. Kawczynski would trace it\
to the classical Asclepiadean verse, as in\
\
    "M\'e6cenas atavis edite regibus,"\
\
which at least has the requisite number of syllables. It appeared in\
France as early as the first part of the twelfth century, and in\
four-line stanzas was the favorite for didactic poetry as late as the\
beginning of the fifteenth century; otherwise, in the close of the\
fourteenth century, it was supplanted by the decasyllabic. In the middle\
of the sixteenth century it again won precedence over the\
decasyllabic--in part through the influence of Ronsard--and is of course\
the standard measure of modern French poetry. The name "alexandrine"\
seems to have been applied in the fifteenth century, from the familiar\
use of the measure in the Alexander romance. The earliest known mention\
of the term is in Herenc's _Doctrinal de la secunde Retorique_. (See\
Stengel's article in Gr\'f6ber's _Grundriss der Romanischen Philologie_,\
from which these statements are taken.)\
\
The French alexandrine is in a sense a quite different measure from the\
English form. Accent is an element of so comparatively slight importance\
in the French language and French rhythm, that its place seems partly to\
be filled by regularity of cesural pause and regularity in the counting\
of syllables. The French alexandrine, therefore, may often be described\
as a verse of twelve syllables, divided into two equal parts by a pause,\
with marked accents on the sixth and twelfth syllables, but with the\
other accents irregularly disposed. Often it seems to an English reader\
to have an anapestic effect, and to be best described as anapestic\
tetrameter. In English, however, while the regularity in the number of\
syllables is followed, and very commonly the medial pause, there is also\
observed the regularity of alternate accents which gives the verse the\
characteristic form indicated by the term "six-stress."\
\
    'Ye nuten hwat ye bidde\'fe, \'feat of gode nabbe\'fe imone;\
    for al eure bileve is on stokke o\'feer on stone:\
    ac \'feeo, \'feat god iknowe\'fe, heo wyten myd iwisse,\
    \'feat hele is icume to monne of folke judaysse.'\
    'Loverd,' heo seyde, 'nu quidde\'fe men, \'feat cumen is Messyas,\
    \'fee king, \'feat wur\'fe and nu\'feen is and ever yete was.\
    hwenne he cume\'fe, he wyle us alle ryhtleche;\
    for he nule ne he ne con nenne mon bipeche.'\
\
(_De Muliere Samaritana_, ll. 51-58. In Morris's _Old English\
Miscellany_, p. 84; and Zupitza's _Alt- und Mittelenglisches\
\'dcbungsbuch_, p. 83. ab. 1250.)\
\
This early poem illustrates the irregular use of alexandrines near the\
time of their introduction into English. The poem opens with a\
septenary--\
\
    "Tho Iesu Crist an eorthe was, mylde weren his dede;"\
\
and septenaries and alexandrines are used interchangeably. Dr. Triggs\
says, in his notes on the poem in McLean's edition of Zupitza's\
_\'dcbungsbuch_, that lines 5, 6, 9-18, 25-28, 39, 40, 43, 44, 49-54, 57,\
58, 63, 64, 66, 67, 70-72, 74, 75 are alexandrines. (Introduction, p.\
lxii.) The English tendency toward indifference to regularity in the\
counting of syllables is also noticeable. In the same way the early poem\
called "The Passion of our Lord" (ed. Morris, E.E.T.S. xlix. 37), which\
is thought from the heading--"_Ici cumence la passyun ihesu crist en\
engleys_"--to be a translation from the French, shows a preponderance of\
alexandrines, although it opens in septenary. See also such poems as the\
"Death," "Doomsday," etc., in the _Old English Miscellany_. The\
alexandrine was easily confused by the Middle English writers, not only\
with the septenary, but with the native "long line," and it is often\
difficult to say just what rhythm was in the writer's mind. Thus a line\
like\
\
    "Be stille, leve soster, thin herte the to-breke,"\
\
from the _Judas_, may be regarded either as an alexandrine or a long\
four-stress line.\
\
    In Westsex was \'fean a kyng, his [name] was Sir Ine.\
    Whan he wist of the Bretons, of werre ne wild he fine.\
    Messengers he sent thorghout Inglond\

\
(ROBERT MANNING of Brunne: _Chronicle of Peter de Langtoft_. Hearne ed.,\
vol. i. p. 2. ab. 1325.)\
\
This poem is one of the very few representatives of distinctly\
alexandrine verse in Middle English. The original poem being in\
alexandrines, Manning followed it closely. In the first part, however,\
he put rimes only at the ends of the verses, whereas later he introduced\
internal rime, thus resolving the verse into short lines of three\
stresses. Schipper observes that the four following lines are each\
representative of a familiar type of the French alexandrine:\
\
    "Messengers he sent \'feorghout Inglond\
    Unto the Inglis kynges, \'feat had it in \'feer hond."\
\
    "After Ethelbert com Elfrith his bro\'feer,\
    \'deat was Egbrihtes sonne and 
\f1 \uc0\u541 
\f0 it \'feer was an o\'feer."\
\
(_Englische Metrik_, vol. i. p. 252.)\
\
The so-called _Legend-Cycle_ is also marked by a sort of alexandrine\
couplet. (See ten Brink's _English Literature_, Kennedy trans., vol. i.\
p. 274.)\
\
    O! think I, had I wings like to the simple dove,\
    This peril might I fly, and seek some place of rest\
    In wilder woods, where I might dwell far from these cares.\
    What speedy way of wing my plaints should they lay on,\
    To 'scape the stormy blast that threatened is to me?\
    Rein those unbridled tongues! break that conjured league!\
    For I decipher'd have amid our town the strife.\
\
    (EARL OF SURREY: _Psalm. LV_. ab. 1540.)\
\
This is a not very successful experiment in unrimed alexandrines. Others\
of Surrey's Psalms are in rimed "Poulter's Measure" (alexandrines\
alternating with septenary).\
\
    O, let me breathe a while, and hold thy heavy hand,\
    My grievous faults with Shame enough I understand.\
    Take ruth and pity on my plaint, or else I am forlorn;\
    Let not the world continue thus in laughing me to scorn.\
    Madam, if I be he, to whom you once were bent,\
    With whom to spend your time sometime you were content:\
    If any hope be left, if any recompense\
    Be able to recover this forepassed negligence,\
    O, help me now, poor wretch, in this most heavy plight,\
    And furnish me yet once again with Tediousness to fight.\
\
(_The Marriage of Wit and Science_, V. ii., in Dodsley's _Old English\
Plays_, ed. Hazlitt, vol. ii. p. 386. ab. 1570.)\
\
In this play the alexandrine is the dominant measure, though mingled\
with occasional septenaries still. (See Schipper, vol. i. p. 256.)\
\
    While favor fed my hope, delight with hope was brought,\
    Thought waited on delight, and speech did follow thought;\
    Then grew my tongue and pen records unto thy glory,\
    I thought all words were lost that were not spent of thee,\
    I thought each place was dark but where thy lights would be,\
    And all ears worse than deaf that heard not out thy story.\
\
(SIDNEY: _Astrophel and Stella_, Fifth Song. [In stanzas _aabccb_.] ab.\
1580.)\
\
See also Sidney's sonnet in alexandrines, p. 272, below.\
\
    Of Albion's glorious isle the wonders whilst I write,\
    The sundry varying soils, the pleasures infinite,\
    (Where heat kills not the cold, nor cold expels the heat,\
    The calms too mildly small, nor winds too roughly great,\
    Nor night doth hinder day, nor day the night doth wrong,\
    The summer not too short, the winter not too long)\
    What help shall I invoke to aid my Muse the while?\
    Thou Genius of the place (this most renowned isle)\
    Which livedst long before the all-earth-drowning flood,\
    Whilst yet the world did swarm with her gigantic brood,\
    Go thou before me still thy circling shores about,\
    And in this wand'ring maze help to conduct me out.\
\
(DRAYTON: _Polyolbion_, ll. 1-12. 1613.)\
\
This is by all odds the longest Modern English poem in alexandrines, and\
while the verse is often agreeable, it illustrates the unfitness of the\
measure--to English ears--for long, continuous poems.\
\
    The dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink;\
    I heard a voice; it said, "Drink, pretty creature, drink!"\
    And looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied\
    A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _The Pet Lamb_. 1800.)\
\
    If hunger, proverbs say, allures the wolf from wood,\
    Much more the bird must dare a dash at something good:\
    Must snatch up, bear away in beak, the trifle-treasure\
    To wood and wild, and then--O how enjoy at leisure!\
    Was never tree-built nest, you climbed and took, of bird,\
    (Rare city-visitant, talked of, scarce seen or heard,)\
    But, when you would dissect the structure, piece by piece,\
    You found, enwreathed amid the country-product--fleece\
    And feather, thistle-fluffs and bearded windlestraws--\
    Some shred of foreign silk, unravelling of gauze,\
    Bit, maybe, of brocade, mid fur and blow-bell-down:\
    Filched plainly from mankind, dear tribute paid by town,\
    Which proved how oft the bird had plucked up heart of grace,\
    Swooped down at waif and stray, made furtively our place\
    Pay tax and toll, then borne the booty to enrich\
    Her paradise i' the waste; the how and why of which,\
    That is the secret, there the mystery that stings!\
\
(BROWNING: _Fifine at the Fair_, ix. 1872.)\
\
Browning has made of the alexandrine in this poem an almost new measure,\
hardly more like the alexandrine couplet of earlier days than the\
measure of _Sordello_ is like the "heroic couplet" proper. In general,\
the modern use of the alexandrine is characterized by increased freedom\
in the placing of the cesura. It is also distinguished from the early\
French and Middle English forms by the fact that the cesura and the\
ending are commonly masculine.\
\
By far the most frequent use of the alexandrine in English poetry is as\
a variant from the five-stress line. For instances of this, see the\
section on the Spenserian stanza, pp. 102-108, above, and Corson's\
chapters on the Spenserian stanza and its influence, in his _Primer of\
English Verse_. In connection with Dryden's use of the alexandrine as a\
variant from the heroic couplet, Mr. Saintsbury makes some interesting\
observations on the measure: "The metre, though a well-known English\
critic has maltreated it of late, is a very fine one; and some of\
Dryden's own lines are unmatched examples of that 'energy divine' which\
has been attributed to him. In an essay on the alexandrine in English\
poetry, which yet remains to be written, and which would be not the\
least valuable of contributions to poetical criticism, this use of the\
verse would have to be considered, as well as its regular recurrent\
employment at the close of the Spenserian stanza, and its continuous\
use.... An examination of the _Polyolbion_ and of _Fifine at the Fair_,\
side by side, would, I think, reveal capacities, somewhat unexpected\
even in this form of arrangement. But so far as the occasional\
alexandrine is concerned, it is not a hyperbole to say that a number,\
out of all proportion, of the best lines in English poetry may be found\
in the closing verses of the Spenserian stave as used by Spenser\
himself, by Shelley, and by the present Laureate, and in the occasional\
alexandrines of Dryden. The only thing to be said against this latter\
use is, that it demands a very skilful ear and hand to adjust the\
cadence." (_Life of Dryden_, in Men of Letters Series, pp. 172, 173.)\
\
\
B.--THE SEPTENARY\
\
The septenary, or seven-stress verse (sometimes called the\
_septenarius_, from the Latin form of the word) was a familiar measure\
of medi\'e6val Latin poetry. There it was more commonly trochaic than\
iambic, as in the famous drinking song of the Goliards:\
\
    "Meum est propositum in taberna mori:\
    Vinum sit appositum morientis ori,\
    Ut dicant cum venerint angelorum chori,\
    'Deus sit propitius huic potatori!'"\
\
(See the "Confessio Goliae," in _Latin Poems attributed to Walter\
Mapes_, ed. Wright, p. 71.)\
\
Another form of the measure is illustrated by some verses quoted by\
Schipper:\
\
    "Fortunae rota volvitur, descendo minoratus,\
    Alter in altum tollitur, nimis exaltatus."\
\
In English, naturally enough, the measure always tended to be iambic. In\
both Latin and English there was considerable freedom as to the number\
of light syllables. It will be noticed that in the specimens just quoted\
from the Latin there is rime not only between the ends of the verses but\
between the syllables just preceding the cesura. Where this was the case\
there was a tendency toward the breaking up of the verse into a quatrain\
of verses in four and three stresses, riming _abab_; such septenaries,\
indeed, were written at pleasure either in couplets or quatrains. We\
shall see the same phenomena in the English forms of the measure. But\
the seven-stress rhythm is not easily lost or mistaken, in whatever form\
it appears, and has a certain charm which at one time appealed very\
widely to metrical taste.\
\
The earliest appearance of the septenary in English is in the _Poema\
Morale_, dated about 1170 by Zupitza, by others somewhat later. For a\
specimen of this, see p. 127, above. Here there is only end-rime, and\
the individuality of the long line is well preserved. There is some\
freedom, however, as to the number of light syllables, and some\
variation between the iambic and trochaic rhythm.\
\
    Blessed beo thu, lavedi, ful of hovene blisse,\
    Swete flur of parais, moder of miltenisse;\
    Thu praye Jhesu Crist thi sone that he me i-wisse,\
    Thare a londe al swo ihc beo, that he me ne i-misse.\
\
(_Hymn to the Virgin_, in M\'e4tzner's _Altenglische Sprachproben_, vol. i.\
p. 54.)\
\
M\'e4tzner prints this poem in short lines of four and three stresses, the\
cesura making such a division natural enough. The next specimen is also\
frequently printed with the same division.\
\
    \'deiss boc iss nemmnedd Orrmulum, forr \'fei \'featt Orrm itt wrohhte,\
    annd itt iss wrohht off qua\'fe\'ferigan, off goddspellbokess fowwre,\
    off qua\'fe\'ferigan Amminadab, off Cristess goddspellbokess;\

\
(_The Ormulum_, ll. 1-9. ab. 1200.)\
\
In this specimen we have the septenary without rime, a rare form. Orm's\
septenaries are also the most regular of the Middle English period,\
preserving an almost painful accuracy throughout the 20,000 extant\
lines of the poem. In general the measure appears in this period in\
combination with alexandrines and other measures, and with much\
irregularity. Like the alexandrine, it was sometimes confused with the\
long four-stress line. In the well-known poem called "A Little Soth\
Sermun" the first line is an unquestionable septenary ("Herkneth alle\
gode men and stylle sitteth a-dun"), but presently we find verse of six\
stresses, and even short four-stress couplets.\
\
    Torne we a

    of erld Olyver and his felawes, \'feat Sarazyns habbe\'fe ynome.\

    and lede\'fe wi\'fe hymen \'feat riche pray, \'fee flour of chyvalrye.\
\
(_Sir Fyrumbras_, ll. 1104-1107. In Zupitza'S _Alt- und Mittelenglisches\
\'dcbungsbuch_, p. 107. ab. 1380.)\
\
In this specimen--from a popular romance--we have the use of cesural\
rime as well as end-rime, just as in the Latin specimens cited above.\
\
    I tell of things done long ago,\
      Of many things in few:\
    And chiefly of this clime of ours\
      The accidents pursue.\
    Thou high director of the same,\
      Assist mine artless pen,\
    To write the gests of Britons stout,\
      And acts of English men.\
\
(WILLIAM WARNER: _Albion's England_, ll. 1-8. 1586.)\
\
Here we have the measure in its "resolved" or divided form, printed as\
short four-stress and three-stress lines, although with rime only at the\
seventh stress. Compare the "common metre" of modern hymns:\
\
    "Must I be carried to the skies\
      On flowery beds of ease,\
    While others fought to win the prize\
      And sailed through bloody seas?"\
\
    As when about the silver moon, when air is free from wind,\
    And stars shine clear, to whose sweet beams, high prospects, and the\
        brows\
    Of all steep hills and pinnacles, thrust up themselves for shows,\
    And even the lowly valleys joy to glitter in their sight,\
    When the unmeasured firmament bursts to disclose her light,\
    And all the signs in heaven are seen, that glad the shepherd's heart;\
    So many fires disclosed their beams, made by the Trojan part,\
    Before the face of Ilion, and her bright turrets show'd.\
    A thousand courts of guard kept fires, and every guard allow'd\
    Fifty stout men, by whom their horse eat oats and hard white corn,\
    And all did wishfully expect the silver-throned morn.\
\
(CHAPMAN: _Iliad_, book VIII. 1610.)\
\
Chapman's translation of _Iliad_ is the longest modern English poem in\
septenaries. Professor Newman, however (whose translation gave rise to\
Matthew Arnold's lectures _On Translating Homer_), used the same measure\
unrimed and with feminine endings; thus,--\
\
    "He spake, and yelling, held afront the single-hoofed horses."\
\
Arnold objected to Chapman's measure that "it has a jogging rapidity\
rather than a flowing rapidity, and a movement familiar rather than\
nobly easy."\
\
    Rejoice, oh, English hearts, rejoice! rejoice, oh, lovers dear!\
    Rejoice, oh, city, town and country! rejoice, eke every shire!\
    For now the fragrant flowers do spring and sprout in seemly sort,\
    The little birds do sit and sing, the lambs do make fine sport;\
    And now the birchen-tree doth bud, that makes the schoolboy cry;\
    The morris rings, while hobby-horse doth foot it feateously;\
    The lords and ladies now abroad, for their disport and play,\
    Do kiss sometimes upon the grass, and sometimes in the hay.\
\
(BEAUMONT: _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_, IV. v. ab. 1610.)\
\
Here the septenary is introduced in the May-day song of Ralph, the\
London apprentice, doubtless because of its popularity for such\
unliterary verse.\
\
    In somer, when the shawes be sheyne,\
      And leves be large and long,\
    Hit is full mery in feyre foreste\
      To here the foulys song.\
\
(_Ballad of Robin Hood and the Monk_, in Gummere's _English Ballads_, p.\
77.)\
\
    It is an ancient Mariner,\
    And he stoppeth one of three.\
    "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,\
    Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?" ...\
\
    ... He prayeth best, who loveth best\
    All things both great and small;\
    For the dear God who loveth us,\
    He made and loveth all.\
\
(COLERIDGE: _The Ancient Mariner_, ll. 1-4, 614-617. 1798.)\
\
These specimens show the ballad stanza, which is made of a sort of\
septenary resolved into short lines of four and three accents. It is\
often assumed that the measure was derived from the Latin septenary; but\
owing to the difficulty of supposing that a foreign metre should have\
been adopted for the most popular of all forms of poetry, some scholars\
prefer to think that the ballad stanza of this form is the same as that\
in which all lines have four accents (see specimen on p. 157, above),\
the last accent of the second and fourth lines having dropped off by\
natural processes. On the ballad stanzas in general, see Gummere's\
_English Ballads_, Appendix II. p. 303. Compare with the present\
specimens the metre of Cowper's _John Gilpin_.\
\
    That cross he now was fastening there, as the surest power and best\
    For supplying all deficiencies, all wants of the rude nest\
    In which, from burning heat, or tempest driving far and wide,\
    The innocent boy, else shelterless, his lonely head must hide.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _The Norman Boy_. 1842.)\
\
This is a rare instance of the use of the long septenary in\
nineteenth-century poetry. Certainly in Wordsworth's verses the metrical\
effect cannot be called happy; the measure is made especially clumsy by\
the introduction of hypermetrical light syllables. In the succeeding\
specimen the same measure is used with feminine ending.\
\
    O poets, from a maniac's tongue was poured the deathless singing!\
    O Christians, at your cross of hope a hopeless hand was clinging!\
    O men, this man in brotherhood your weary paths beguiling,\
    Groaned inly while he taught you peace, and died while ye were smiling!\
\
(ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING: _Cowper's Grave_. 1833.)\
\
\
C.--THE "POULTER'S MEASURE."\
\
In the Elizabethan age the alexandrine and the septenary were each used\
chiefly in conjunction with the other, in alternation of six-stress and\
seven-stress verses. The name commonly applied to the combination is\
taken from Gascoigne's _Notes of Instruction_ (1575), where he says:\
"The commonest sort of verse which we use now adayes (viz. the long\
verse of twelve and fourtene sillables) I know not certainly howe to\
name it, unlesse I should say that it doth consist of Poulters measure,\
which giveth xii. for one dozen and xiiii. for another." (Arber's\
Reprint, p. 39.) It strikes the reader with surprise to find the measure\
thus spoken of as "the commonest sort of verse," but a glance at any of\
the early Elizabethan anthologies will show the justness of Gascoigne's\
words. Yet the measure, while exceedingly popular, seems to have been\
instinctively avoided by the best poets (after the days of Surrey and\
Sidney); hence it is unfamiliar to modern readers.\
\
The use of alexandrines and septenaries together, we have seen, was\
common even in the Middle English period, but not in regular\
alternation. The Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (about 1300) mingles\
both measures, but with alexandrines predominating. In some of the early\
Mystery Plays they are found in alternation; for example, where Jacob,\
in one of the Towneley plays, is relating his hunger to Esau:\
\
    "Meat or drink, save my life, or bread, I reck not what:\
    If there be nothing else, some man give me a cat."\
\
See also the specimen from _The Marriage of Wit and Science_, p. 256,\
above.\
\
Schipper says that he does not know who first brought the two measures\
together in alternate use for lyrical poetry. Guest says that the\
Poulter's Measure came into fashion soon after 1500 (_History of English\
Rhythms_), but gives no examples so early. The history of the measure\
should be further investigated.\
\
After the Elizabethan period the Poulter's Measure practically\
disappears from English poetry. A curious suggestion of it may be found\
in a little poem of Leigh Hunt's (_Wealth and Womanhood_), cited by\
Schipper, who calls the verse "Poulter's Measure in trochaics":\
\
    "Have you seen an heiress in her jewels mounted,\
    Till her wealth and she seemed one, and she might be counted?"\
\
    Laid in my quiet bed, in study as I were,\
    I saw within my troubled head a heap of thoughts appear:\
    And every thought did show so lively in mine eyes,\
    That now I sighed, and then I smiled, as cause of thought doth rise.\
\
(EARL OF SURREY: _How no Age is Content with his Own Estate_, in\
Tottel's _Songs and Sonnets_. Arber's Reprint, p. 30. Pub. 1557.)\
\
    Her forehead jacinth like, her cheeks of opal hue,\
    Her twinkling eyes bedeck'd with pearl, her lips as sapphire blue;\
    Her hair like crapal stone, her mouth O heavenly wide;\
    Her skin like burnish'd gold, her hands like silver ore untried.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Mopsa_, in the _Arcadia_. ab. 1580.)\
\
\
\
\
IV. THE SONNET\
\
\
The sonnet is an Italian verse-form, in fourteen five-stress lines,\
introduced into England at the time of the Italian literary influences\
of the sixteenth century. Almost from the first, the English sonnet has\
been divided into two classes: one based on more or less strict\
imitation of the structure of the Italian form, and variously called the\
Italian, the regular, or the legitimate sonnet; the other taking the\
Italian sonnet as the point of departure, but constructed according to\
more familiar English rime-schemes, and commonly called the Shaksperian\
or the English sonnet.\
\
The origin of the sonnet in southern Europe is a matter of some\
disagreement. Some scholars trace it to the _canzone_ strophe (_e.g._\
Gaspary, in his _Geschichte der Italienischen Literatur_), others to the\
combination of the _ottava rima_ with a six-line stanza (Welti, in his\
_Geschichte des Sonettes in der deutschen Dichtung_), others to\
Proven\'e7al and even German influence. (See Schipper, vol. ii. pp. 835\
ff., and Lentzner's _Das Sonett und seine Gestaltung in der englischen\
Dichtung_, p. 1.) It seems first to have been a recognized form in Italy\
in the latter part of the thirteenth century (see Tomlinson's _The\
Sonnet: its Origin, Structure, and Place in Poetry_); and was made\
glorious by Dante, Michael Angelo, Tasso, Ariosto, and--above\
all--Petrarch. On the different forms of the Italian sonnet, see\
Tomlinson's essay, just cited.\
\
"The object of the regular or legitimate Italian sonnet," says Mr.\
Tomlinson, "is to express one, and only one, idea, mood, sentiment, or\
proposition, and this must be introduced ... in the first quatrain, and\
so far explained in the second, that this may end in a full point; while\
the office of the first tercet is to prepare the leading idea of the\
quatrains for the conclusion, which conclusion is to be perfectly\
carried out in the second tercet, so that it may contain the fundamental\
idea of the poem." (pp. 27, 28.)\
\
The Italian form is always marked by the division into octave and\
sestet, although English usage has been very irregular in marking this\
division by a full pause. The octave is based on only two rimes\
(_abbaabba_); the sestet on either two or three, the most common\
arrangements being _cdecde, cdcdcd, cdedce_, and _cddcee_.\
\
With regard to the pause at the point of division Lentzner says: "It\
should not be a full pause, because this would produce the effect of a\
gap or breaking-off, ...--not like the speaker who has reached the end\
of what he has to say, but like one who reflects on what has already\
been said, and then takes fresh breath to complete his theme."[35]\
\
Most critics prefer those forms of sestet which avoid a final riming\
couplet. This Mr. Courthope explains as follows: "The reason for the\
avoidance of the couplet in the second portion of the sonnet is, I\
think, plain. In the first eight lines the thought ascends to a climax;\
this part of the sonnet may be said to contain the premises of the\
poetical syllogism. In the last six lines the idea descends to a\
conclusion, and as the two divisions are of unequal length it is\
necessary that the lesser should be the more individualised. Hence\
while, in the first part, the expression of the thought is massed and\
condensed by reduplications of sound, and the general movement is\
limited by quatrains; in the second part the clauses are separated by\
the alternation of the rhymes, the movement is measured by tercets, and\
the whole weight of the rhetorical emphasis is thrown into the last\
line." (_History of English Poetry_, vol. ii. p. 91.)\
\
The sonnet has remained, since its introduction into English poetry, a\
favorite form among poets and critics, but has never become genuinely\
popular. It is suited, of course, only for the expression of dignified\
and careful thinking; and the difficulty of giving it unity and\
confining the content to the precise limit of fourteen lines has made\
perfect success in the form a rare attainment. Furthermore, the\
complexity of the rime-scheme--the distance at which one rime responds\
to another--makes the appreciation of the form a matter of some\
delicacy, less suited to the prevailingly simple taste of the English\
ear than to the more complex taste of the Italian.\
\
The following specimens are classified only in the two principal groups\
of the Italian and the English form. The common test of the Italian form\
is that the rime-scheme shall separate the first eight lines from the\
rest, these eight lines ordinarily showing "inclusive rime" of the\
_abba_ type; the test of the English form is that the rime-scheme shall\
separate the first twelve lines from the last two, the twelve lines\
ordinarily showing alternate rime.\
\
Schipper groups English sonnets in five classes: (1) the strict Italian\
form, with pause between octave and sestet; (2) the Surrey-Shakspere or\
English form; (3) the Spenserian form; (4) the Miltonic form, with\
correct rime-arrangement but general neglect of the bipartite structure;\
(5) the modern Italian or Wordsworthian form, following the regular\
rime-scheme in general, but often with a third or even a fourth rime in\
the octave, and treated as a single strophe. (_Englische Metrik_, vol.\
ii. p. 878.)[36]\
\
\
A.--THE REGULAR (ITALIAN) SONNET\
\
In this group the student of the subject should note the detailed\
variations of the rime-scheme of the sestet, and the varying practice of\
the poets as to the division between octave and sestet.\
\
In view of the connection of Petrarch's sonnets with Wyatt's\
introduction of the form into England, the first of them is reproduced\
as a typical specimen of the strict Italian form.\
\
    Voi ch' ascoltate in rime sparse il suono\
    Di quei sospiri ond' io nudriva 'l core\
    In su 'l mio primo giovenile errore,\
    Quand' era in parte altr' uom da quel ch' i' sono,\
    Del vario stile, in ch' io piango e ragiono\
    Fra le vane speranze e 'l van dolore,\
    Ove sia chi per prova intenda amore\
    Spero trovar piet\'e0, non che perdono.\
    Ma ben veggi' or s\'ed come al popol tutto\
    Favola fui gran tempo, onde sovente\
    Di me medesmo meco mi vergogno;\
    E del mio vaneggiar vergogna \'e8 'l frutto,\
    E 'l pentirsi, e 'l conoscer chiaramente\
    Che quanto piace al mondo \'e8 breve sogno.\
\
(PETRARCA: _Sonetto_ i.)\
\
    The longe love that in my thought I harber,\
    And in my heart doth kepe his residence,\
    Into my face preaseth with bold pretence,\
    And there campeth, displaying his banner.\
    She that me learns to love, and to suffer,\
    And willes that my trust, and lustes negligence\
    Be reined by reason, shame, and reverence,\
    With his hardinesse takes displeasure.\
    Wherwith love to the hartes forest he fleeth,\
    Leavyng his enterprise with paine and crye,\
    And there him hideth and not appeareth.\
    What may I do? when my maister feareth,\
    But in the field with him to live and dye,\
    For good is the life, endyng faithfully.\
\
(SIR THOMAS WYATT: _The lover hideth his desire_, etc., in Tottel's\
_Songs and Sonnets_, p. 33. pub. 1557.)\
\
It was Wyatt who introduced the sonnet into England. Thirty-one of his\
sonnets were published in Tottel's Miscellany, of which about a third\
are said to be translations or paraphrases of Petrarch's. Wyatt\
followed, of course, the regular Italian structure, but used\
unhesitatingly the form of sestet with the concluding couplet\
(_cddcee_). On this point Mr. Courthope says: "Wyatt was evidently\
unaware of the secret principle underlying the extremely complex\
structure of the Italian sonnet; ... and being unfortunately misled by\
his admiration for the _Strambotti_ of Serafino, which sum up the\
conclusion in a couplet, he endeavored to construct his sonnets on the\
same principle, thereby leading all sonnet writers before Milton on a\
wrong path." (_History of English Poetry_, vol. ii. p. 91.)\
\
    Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,\
    That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,--\
    Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,\
    Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,--\
    I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;\
    Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,\
    Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow\
    Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sun-burn'd brain.\
    But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay;\
    Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows,\
    And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.\
    Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,\
    Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,--\
    'Fool,' said my Muse to me, 'Look in thy heart, and write.'\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Astrophel and Stella_, i. ab. 1580.)\
\
    With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!\
    How silently, and with how wan a face!\
    What, may it be that e'en in heavenly place\
    That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!\
    Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes\
    Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,\
    I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace,\
    To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.\
    Then, e'en of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,\
    Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?\
    Are beauties there as proud as here they be?\
    Do they above love to be loved, and yet\
    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?\
    Do they call virtue, there, ungratefulness?\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Astrophel and Stella_, xxxi. ab. 1580.)\
\
Sidney's favorite form for the sonnet sestet was that shown in these\
specimens (_cdcdee_), a form that suggests the influence of the Surrey\
or English sonnet rather than the Italian. The first of the sonnets is\
of course exceptional in being written in alexandrines, but is among the\
finest in the sequence. See also Sidney's sonnet of the English type, p.\
291, below.\
\
The _Astrophel and Stella_ (containing 110 sonnets) is the earliest of\
the great sonnet-sequences or sonnet-cycles of English poetry, those of\
Spenser, Shakspere, Rossetti, and Mrs. Browning being later\
representatives. In the Elizabethan age the fashion of writing sonnets,\
and sonnet-sequences in particular, was at its height, especially in the\
last decade of the century (1590-1600). On this subject, see the\
Introduction to Professor Schelling's _Elizabethan Lyrics_, in the\
Athen\'e6um Press Series, and Mr. Sidney Lee's _Life of Shakspere_. Other\
noteworthy sonnet-sequences besides those of Sidney, Spenser, and\
Shakspere were Constable's _Diana_, Daniel's _Delia_, Lodge's _Phyllis_,\
Watson's _Tears of Fancy_, Barnes's _Parthenophil_, Giles Fletcher's\
_Lycia_, and Drayton's _Idea_,--all published in the years 1592-1594. A\
now forgotten poet by the name of Lok produced more than four hundred\
sonnets, proving himself an Elizabethan rival to Wordsworth.\
\
    I know that all beneath the moon decays,\
    And what by mortals in this world is brought\
    In time's great periods shall return to naught;\
    That fairest states have fatal nights and days.\
    I know how all the Muse's heavenly lays,\
    With toil of spirit which are so dearly bought,\
    As idle sounds, of few or none are sought;\
    And that naught lighter is than airy praise.\
    I know frail beauty like the purple flower,\
    To which one morn oft birth and death affords;\
    That love a jarring is of minds' accords,\
    Where sense and will invassall reason's power.\
    Know what I list, this all can not me move,\
    But that, O me! I both must write and love.\
\
(WILLIAM DRUMMOND of Hawthornden: _Sense of the Fragility of All\
Things_, etc. 1616.)\
\
Drummond was a sonneteer of great skill, and used many original\
combinations of rime-schemes,--some forty in all,--yet usually\
approximating to the Italian type. Leigh Hunt says: "Drummond's sonnets,\
for the most part, are not only of the legitimate order, but they are\
the earliest in the language that breathe what may be called the habit\
of mind observable in the best Italian writers of sonnets; that is to\
say, a mixture of tenderness, elegance, love of country, seclusion, and\
conscious sweetness of verse." (Essay on the Sonnet, in _The Book of the\
Sonnet_, vol. i. pp. 78, 79.)\
\
    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee\
    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\
    For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow\
    Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me.\
    From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,\
    Much pleasure: then from thee much more must flow;\
    And soonest our best men do with thee go--\
    Rest of their bones, and souls' delivery.\
    Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\
    And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\
    And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\
    And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then?\
    One short sleep past, we wake eternally,\
    And death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die.\
\
(JOHN DONNE: _Holy Sonnets_, X. 1635.)\
\
Donne's series of "Holy Sonnets" was one of the few Elizabethan\
sequences, or cycles, which dealt with other than amatory subjects. The\
seven sonnets of the series called _La Corona_ are bound together into a\
"crown of sonnets,"--an Italian fashion, according to which the first\
line of each sonnet is the same as the last of the sonnet preceding, and\
the last line of the last sonnet the same as the first line of the\
first.\
\
    When I consider how my light is spent\
    Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,\
    And that one talent which is death to hide\
    Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent\
    To serve therewith my Maker, and present\
    My true account, lest He returning chide,--\
    Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?\
    I fondly ask:--But patience, to prevent\
    That murmur, soon replies: God doth not need\
    Either man's work, or His own gifts; who best\
    Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best: His state\
    Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed\
    And post o'er land and ocean without rest:--\
    They also serve who only stand and wait.\
\
(MILTON: _On his Blindness_. ab. 1655.)\
\
Milton learned the sonnet direct from the Italian, and wrote five in\
that language. While following the Italian rime-schemes, however, he was\
not careful to observe any division between octave and sestet. Like\
Donne, he turned the sonnet to other subjects than that of love, or--in\
Landor's words--\
\
    "He caught the sonnet from the dainty hand\
    Of Love, who cried to lose it, and he gave\
    The notes to Glory."\
\
(_To Lamartine._)\
\
Compare, also, Wordsworth's saying that in Milton's hand\
\
    "The Thing became a trumpet, whence he blew\
    Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!"\
\
Besides the eighteen English sonnets in regular form, Milton wrote a\
"tailed," or "caudated," sonnet, following an Italian fashion,--"On the\
New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament." "He intended it,"\
says Masson, "to be what may be called an Anti-Presbyterian and\
Pro-Toleration Sonnet; but by going beyond fourteen lines, converted it\
into what the Italians called a 'sonnet with a tail.'" (Globe ed., p.\
440.) The "tail" rimes _cfffgg_.\
\
    Deem not devoid of elegance the sage,\
    By Fancy's genuine feelings unbeguiled,\
    Of painful pedantry the poring child,\
    Who turns, of these proud domes, th' historic page,\
    Now sunk by Time, and Henry's fiercer rage.\
    Think'st thou the warbling Muses never smiled\
    On his lone hours? Ingenuous views engage\
    His thoughts, on themes, unclassic falsely styled,\
    Intent. While cloistered Piety displays\
    Her mouldering roll, the piercing eye explores\
    New manners, and the pomp of elder days,\
    Whence culls the pensive bard his pictured stores.\
    Nor rough nor barren are the winding ways\
    Of hoar Antiquity, but strown with flowers.\
\
(THOMAS WARTON: _In a Blank Leaf of Dugdale's 'Monasticon.'_ ab. 1775.)\
\
After Milton, the sonnet fell into disuse for a century. "Walsh," says\
Mr. Gosse, "is the author of the only sonnet written in English between\
Milton's, in 1658, and Warton's, about 1750." (Ward's _English Poets_,\
vol. iii. p. 7.) See, however, that of Gray on West, written in 1742,\
quoted p. 295, below. To the Warton brothers, pioneers in so many ways\
of the romantic revival, chief credit is given for the revival of the\
sonnet in the eighteenth century. Other sonneteers of the period were\
William Mason, Thomas Edwards, Benjamin Stillingfleet, and Thomas\
Russell (see Seccombe's _Age of Johnson_, pp. 254, 255, and Beers's\
_English Romanticism in the Eighteenth Century_, pp. 160, 161).\
\
    O Time! who know'st a lenient hand to lay\
    Softest on sorrow's wound, and slowly thence\
    (Lulling to sad repose the weary sense)\
    The faint pang stealest, unperceived, away;\
    On thee I rest my only hope at last,\
    And think when thou hast dried the bitter tear\
    That flows in vain o'er all my soul held dear,\
    I may look back on every sorrow past,\
    And meet life's peaceful evening with a smile.\
    As some lone bird, at day's departing hour,\
    Sings in the sunbeam, of the transient shower\
    Forgetful, though its wings are wet the while:\
    Yet ah! how much must that poor heart endure\
    Which hopes from thee, and thee alone, a cure!\
\
(WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES: _To Time_. 1789.)\
\
Bowles (1762-1850) wrote numerous sonnets, and was influential in\
carrying on the movement begun by the Wartons. His sonnets were admired,\
in particular, by Coleridge and Wordsworth, the former poet dedicating\
to him a sonnet beginning:\
\
    "My heart has thanked thee, Bowles! for those soft strains\
    Whose sadness soothes me."\
\
His sonnets were, however, neglectful of the regular Italian structure,\
so that under his influence, as Leigh Hunt observed, "the illegitimate\
order ... became such a favorite with lovers of easy writing who could\
string fourteen lines together, that ... it continued to fill the press\
with heaps of bad verses, till the genius of Wordsworth succeeded in\
restoring the right system." (_Essay on the Sonnet_, p. 85.) But see the\
notes on Wordsworth's sonnets, p. 280, below.\
\
    Mary! I want a lyre with other strings,\
    Such aid from Heaven as some have feigned they drew,\
    An eloquence scarce given to mortals, new\
    And undebased by praise of meaner things,\
    That, ere through age or woe I shed my wings,\
    I may record thy worth with honor due,\
    In verse as musical as thou art true,\
    And that immortalizes whom it sings.\
    But thou hast little need. There is a book\
    By Seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light,\
    On which the eyes of God not rarely look,\
    A chronicle of actions just and bright:\
    There all thy deeds, my faithful Mary, shine,\
    And, since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee mine.\
\
(COWPER: _To Mrs. Unwin_. 1793.)\
\
    Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room;\
    And hermits are contented with their cells;\
    And students with their pensive citadels;\
    Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,\
    Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,\
    High as the highest peak of Furness Fells,\
    Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells.\
    In truth the prison unto which we doom\
    Ourselves no prison is; and hence to me,\
    In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound\
    Within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground,\
    Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)\
    Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,\
    Should find brief solace there, as I have found.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _The Sonnet_. 1806.)\
\
    Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned,\
    Mindless of its just honors; with this key\
    Shakspere unlocked his heart; the melody\
    Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;\
    A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;\
    With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief;\
    The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf\
    Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned\
    His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,\
    It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land\
    To struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp\
    Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand\
    The Thing became a trumpet, whence he blew\
    Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _Scorn not the Sonnet_. 1827.)\
\
    The World is too much with us; late and soon,\
    Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;\
    Little we see in Nature that is ours;\
    We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\
    This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,\
    The winds that will be howling at all hours\
    And are up-gather'd now like sleeping flowers,\
    For this, for every thing, we are out of tune;\
    It moves us not.--Great God! I'd rather be\
    A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,--\
    So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\
    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\
    Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\
    Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _The World is too much with us_. 1806.)\
\
Wordsworth's complaint as to the number of Milton's sonnets ("alas, too\
few!") certainly cannot be applied to his own. They number about five\
hundred, ranking him as the most prolific English sonneteer. These\
include some of the finest sonnets in the language, and very many of\
admittedly indifferent quality. Mr. Swinburne regards his sonnets as on\
the whole "the best out of sight" in our poetry. In general he followed\
the Italian model, but with very great liberty. He not only practised\
great variety of rime-arrangement in the sestet, but frequently altered\
the scheme of the octave to such forms as _abbaacca_; see, for example,\
the specimen beginning "Scorn not the Sonnet." Wordsworth also showed no\
regard for the careful division of thought between octave and sestet.\
Indeed in a letter to Dyce, in 1833, he said that he regarded the sonnet\
not as a piece of architecture, but as "an orbicular body,--a sphere or\
a dew-drop." (_Works_, ed. Knight, vol. xi. p. 232.) Its excellence\
seemed to him to consist mainly in a "pervading sense of intense unity."\
Nevertheless, he admitted that "a sonnet will often be found excellent,\
where the beginning, the middle, and the end are distinctly marked, and\
also where it is distinctly separated into _two_ parts, to which, as I\
before observed, the strict Italian model, as they write it, is\
favorable."\
\
    Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew\
    Thee from report divine, and heard thy name,\
    Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,\
    This glorious canopy of light and blue?\
    Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,\
    Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,\
    Hesperus with the host of heaven came,\
    And lo! creation widened in man's view.\
    Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed\
    Within thy beams, O Sun! or who could find,\
    Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,\
    That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind?\
    Why do we, then, shun death with anxious strife?\
    If light can thus deceive, wherefore not life?\
\
(JOSEPH BLANCO WHITE: _To Night_. ab. 1825. In _The Book of the Sonnet_,\
i. 258.)\
\
This famous sonnet was called by Coleridge "the best in the English\
language." He seems, however, to have been led to this opinion rather by\
the thought than the form.\
\
    I met a traveler from an antique land,\
    Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\
    Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,\
    Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown\
    And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command\
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read\
    Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,\
    The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed;\
    And on the pedestal these words appear:\
    "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\
    Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"\
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,\
    The lone and level sands stretch far away.\
\
(SHELLEY: _Ozymandias of Egypt_. 1817.)\
\
Shelley wrote but few sonnets, and all but one (_To the Nile_) are\
irregular in structure. The rime-scheme of the present specimen is, of\
course, wholly eccentric.\
\
    The poetry of earth is never dead:\
    When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,\
    And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run\
    From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead:\
    That is the Grasshopper's; he takes the lead\
    In summer luxury; he has never done\
    With his delights, for, when tired out with fun,\
    He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.\
    The poetry of earth is ceasing never:\
    On a lone winter evening, when the frost\
    Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills\
    The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,\
    And seems to one in drowsiness half lost\
    The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.\
\
(KEATS: _The Grasshopper and Cricket_. 1817.)\
\
Keats's sonnets are for the most part regular in both rime-scheme and\
bipartite structure; but a number of the posthumous sonnets are in the\
English form. The present specimen (which competes with the more\
familiar sonnet on _Chapman's Homer_ for the chief place among those of\
Keats) is a particularly good example of the bipartite structure and its\
organic relation to the thought of the sonnet.\
\
    Amazing monster! that, for aught I know,\
    With the first sight of thee didst make our race\
    Forever stare! O flat and shocking face,\
    Grimly divided from the breast below!\
    Thou that on dry land horribly dost go\
    With a split body and most ridiculous pace,\
    Prong after prong, disgracer of all grace,\
    Long-useless-finned, haired, upright, unwet, slow!\
    O breather of unbreathable, sword-sharp air,\
    How canst exist? How bear thyself, thou dry\
    And dreary sloth! What particle canst thou share\
    Of the only blessed life, the watery?\
    I sometimes see of ye an actual _pair_\
    Go by, linked fin by fin! most odiously.\
\
(LEIGH HUNT: _The Fish to the Man_. 1836.)\
\
    If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange\
    And be all to me? Shall I never miss\
    Home-talk and blessing, and the common kiss\
    That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,\
    When I look up, to drop on a new range\
    Of walls and floors,--another home than this?\
    Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is\
    Fill'd by dead eyes, too tender to know change?\
    That's hardest! If to conquer love, has tried,\
    To conquer grief tries more, as all things prove:\
    For grief indeed is love, and grief beside.\
    Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love--\
    Yet love me--wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,\
    And fold within the wet wings of thy dove.\
\
(ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING: _Sonnets from the Portuguese_, xxxv.\
1850.)\
\
The forty-four _Sonnets from the Portuguese_ (the title, of course,\
being purely fanciful) constitute one of the chief sonnet-sequences of\
the modern period. While true to the Italian rime-structure, Mrs.\
Browning cannot be said to have treated the sonnet either as a two-part\
poem or as a unit. Only three of the series, says Professor Corson (the\
first, fourth, and thirteenth), "can be said to realize with any\
distinctness the idea and the peculiar artistic effect of the sonnet\
proper." Hence while calling them "the most beautiful love-poems in the\
language," he thinks "they cannot be classed as sonnets." (_Primer of\
English Verse_, pp. 175, 176.)\
\
    A Sonnet is a moment's monument,--\
    Memorial from the Soul's eternity\
    To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,\
    Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,\
    Of its own arduous fulness reverent:\
    Carve it in ivory or in ebony,\
    As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see\
    Its flowering crest impearled and orient.\
    A sonnet is a coin: its face reveals\
    The soul,--its converse, to what Power 'tis due:--\
    Whether for tribute to the august appeals\
    Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,\
    It serve; or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,\
    In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death.\
\
(ROSSETTI: Sonnet preceding _The House of Life_. 1881.)\
\
    When do I see thee most, beloved one?\
    When in the light the spirits of mine eyes\
    Before thy face, their altar, solemnize\
    The worship of that Love through thee made known?\
    Or when in the dusk hours (we two alone),\
    Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies\
    Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,\
    And my soul only sees thy soul its own?\
    O love, my love! if I no more should see\
    Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,\
    Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,--\
    How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope\
    The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,\
    The wind of Death's imperishable wing?\
\
(ROSSETTI: _The House of Life_: Sonnet iv. _Lovesight_. 1870.)\
\
The sonnets of Rossetti are undoubtedly the most perfect representatives\
of the Italian form in English poetry of the nineteenth century, and\
_The House of Life_ (in 101 sonnets) is probably to be regarded as the\
most important sonnet-sequence since the Elizabethan age. The bipartite\
character of Rossetti's sonnets is marked, in editions of his poems, by\
the printing of the octave and sestet with a space between them.\
\
    They rose to where their sovran eagle sails,\
    They kept their faith, their freedom, on the height,\
    Chaste, frugal, savage, armed by day and night\
    Against the Turk; whose inroad nowhere scales\
    Their headlong passes, but his footstep fails,\
    And red with blood the Crescent reels from fight\
    Before their dauntless hundreds, in prone flight\
    By thousands down the crags and through the vales.\
    O smallest among peoples! rough rock-throne\
    Of Freedom! warriors beating back the swarm\
    Of Turkish Islam for five hundred years,\
    Great Tsernagora! never since thine own\
    Black ridges drew the cloud and brake the storm\
    Has breathed a race of mightier mountaineers.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Montenegro_. 1877.)\
\
It is curious that the two chief representatives of English poetry of\
the Victorian period, Tennyson and Browning, should neither of them have\
given much attention to the sonnet nor have achieved any notable success\
in the form. Among Tennyson's poems there are some seventeen sonnets, of\
which the present specimen was considered by the poet to be the best. It\
represents a common form of the bipartite structure, where the octave is\
a narrative, and the sestet a comment upon what has been narrated. In\
the following specimen, from Matthew Arnold, the structure is similar.\
Lentzner quotes the _East London_, in his monograph on the English\
sonnet, as a case where the octave represents the thought in particular,\
the sestet in the abstract; in other cases the order is the reverse.\
\
    'Twas August, and the fierce sun overhead\
    Smote on the squalid streets of Bethnal Green,\
    And the pale weaver, through his window seen\
    In Spitalfields, looked thrice dispirited.\
    I met a preacher there I knew, and said:\
    'Ill and o'er-worked, how fare you in this scene?'\
    'Bravely!' said he, 'for I of late have been\
    Much cheered with thoughts of Christ, the Living Bread!'\
    O human soul! so long as thou canst so\
    Set up a mark of everlasting light\
    Above the howling senses' ebb and flow,\
    To cheer thee and to right thee if thou roam,\
    Not with lost toil thou laborest through the night!\
    Thou mak'st the heaven thou hop'st indeed thy home.\
\
(MATTHEW ARNOLD: _East London_. 1867.)\
\
    "Why?" Because all I haply can and do,\
    All that I am now, all I hope to be,--\
    Whence comes it save from fortune setting free\
    Body and soul the purpose to pursue,\
    God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,\
    Of prejudice, convention, fall from me,\
    These shall I bid men--each in his degree\
    Also God-guided--bear, and gayly too?\
    But little do or can the best of us:\
    That little is achieved through Liberty.\
    Who, then, dares hold, emancipated thus--\
    His fellow shall continue bound? Not I.\
    Who live, love, labor freely, nor discuss\
    A brother's right to freedom. That is "Why."\
\
(BROWNING: _Why I am a Liberal_. 1885.)\
\
Browning's sonnets are few in number, mostly occasional, and none of\
them can be considered notable. For a study of them, see the article by\
Lentzner in _Anglia_, vol. xi. p. 500. Dr. Lentzner includes nine in his\
list, not all of which are included in Browning's collected poems. Three\
are so closely connected as practically to form a poem in three stanzas\
(appended to _Jochanan Hakkadosh_, 1883).\
\
    One saith: the whole world is a Comedy\
    Played for the mirth of God upon his throne,\
    Whereof the hidden meanings will be known\
    When Michael's trumpet thrills through earth and sea.\
    Fate is the dramaturge; Necessity\
    Allots the parts; the scenes, by Nature shown,\
    Embrace each element and every zone,\
    Ordered with infinite variety.Another\
    saith: no calm-eyed Sophocles\
    Indites the tragedy of human doom,\
    But some cold scornful Aristophanes,\
    Whose zanies gape and gibber in thick gloom,\
    While nightingales, shrill 'mid the shivering trees,\
    Jar on the silence of the neighboring tomb.\
\
(JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS: from _Sonnets on the Thought of Death_. ab.\
1880.)\
\
    Yon silvery billows breaking on the beach\
    Fall back in foam beneath the star-shine clear,\
    The while my rhymes are murmuring in your ear\
    A restless lore like that the billows teach;\
    For on these sonnet-waves my soul would reach\
    From its own depths, and rest within you, dear,\
    As, through the billowy voices yearning here,\
    Great Nature strives to find a human speech.\
    A sonnet is a wave of melody:\
    From heaving waters of the impassioned soul\
    A billow of tidal music one and whole\
    Flows in the octave; then, returning free,\
    Its ebbing surges in the sestet roll\
    Back to the deeps of Life's tumultuous sea.\
\
(THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON: _The Sonnet's Voice; a Metrical Lesson by the\
Sea-shore_. _Athen\'e6um_, Sept. 17, 1881.)\
\
The "sonnet on the sonnet" has become so familiar in recent times that a\
volume of such sonnets has been compiled, and a writer of humorous verse\
has satirized the fashion in a "Sonnet on the Sonnet on the Sonnet."\
Doubtless the two specimens quoted from Wordsworth lead all others of\
the class; but the present specimen is an interesting attempt to\
represent the characteristic metrical expressiveness of the form.\
\
    Oft have I seen at some cathedral door\
    A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,\
    Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet\
    Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor\
    Kneel to repeat his Paternoster o'er;\
    Far off the noises of the world retreat;\
    The loud vociferations of the street\
    Become an undistinguishable roar.\
    So, as I enter here from day to day,\
    And leave my burden at this minster gate,\
    Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,\
    The tumult of the time disconsolate\
    To inarticulate murmurs dies away,\
    While the eternal ages watch and wait.\
\
(LONGFELLOW: _Sonnets on the Divina Commedia_, i. 1864.)\
\
    Caliph, I did thee wrong. I hailed thee late\
    "Abdul the Damned," and would recall my word.\
    It merged thee with the unillustrious herd\
    Who crowd the approaches to the infernal gate--\
    Spirits gregarious, equal in their state\
    As is the innumerable ocean bird,\
    Gannet or gull, whose wandering plaint is heard\
    On Ailsa or Iona desolate.\
    For, in a world where cruel deeds abound,\
    The merely damned are legion: with such souls\
    Is not each hollow and cranny of Tophet crammed?\
    Thou with the brightest of Hell's aureoles\
    Dost shine supreme, incomparably crowned,\
    Immortally, beyond all mortals, damned.\

Mr. William Archer says of Mr. Watson's political sonnets, that the form\
becomes in his hands "a weapon like the sling of David. In the octave he\
whirls it round and round with ever-gathering momentum, and in the\
sestet sends his scorn or rebuke singing through the air, arrow-straight\
to its mark." (_Poets of the Younger Generation_, p. 503.)\

\
B.--THE ENGLISH (SHAKSPERIAN) SONNET\
\
    From Tuskane came my Ladies worthy race:\
    Faire Florence was sometyme her auncient seate:\
    The Western yle, whose pleasaunt shore dothe face\
    Wilde Cambers clifs, did geve her lively heate:\
    Fostered she was with milke of Irishe brest:\
    Her sire, an Erle; her dame, of princes blood.\
    From tender yeres, in Britain she doth rest,\
    With kinges childe, where she tasteth costly food.\
    Honsdon did first present her to mine yien:\
    Bright is her hewe, and Geraldine she hight.\
    Hampton me taught to wishe her first for mine:\
    And Windsor, alas, dothe chase me from her sight.\
    Her beauty of kind, her vertues from above.\
    Happy is he that can obtaine her love.\
\
(EARL OF SURREY: _Description and praise of his love Geraldine_. In\
Tottel's _Songs and Sonnets_, p. 9. Pub. 1557.)\
\
Surrey experimented with the Italian sonnet as it had been introduced\
into England by his master Wyatt, but soon devised a variation from the\
Italian form, and wrote a majority of his sonnets in the new English\
form (nine out of the sixteen which are printed in Tottel's Miscellany).\
This new form is divided, not into octave and sestet, but into three\
quatrains, with alternate rime, and a couplet. It produces, therefore,\
an effect quite different from that of the legitimate Italian sonnet,\
the couplet at the end giving it a more epigrammatic structure.\
Surrey's form seems more consonant with common English taste for\
simplicity of rime-structure, and, besides being honored by its adoption\
by Shakspere, has remained a favorite side by side with the more\
"correct" original.[37]\
\
    Come, Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,\
    The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,\
    The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,\
    The indifferent judge between the high and low;\
    With shield of proof shield me from out the press\
    Of those fierce darts Despair at me doth throw.\
    O make me in those civil wars to cease;\
    I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.\
    Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,\
    A chamber deaf of noise and blind of light,\
    A rosy garland and a weary head:\
    And if these things, as being thine in right,\
    Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,\
    Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.\
\
(SIDNEY: _Astrophel and Stella_, xxxix. ab. 1580.)\
\
    Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,\
    Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,\
    Relieve my languish, and restore the light;\
    With dark forgetting of my care return.\
    And let the day be time enough to mourn\
    The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth:\
    Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,\
    Without the torment of the night's untruth.\
    Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires,\
    To model forth the passions of to-morrow;\
    Never let rising Sun approve you liars,\
    To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow:\
    Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain,\
    And never wake to feel the day's disdain.\
\
(SAMUEL DANIEL: _Care-charmer Sleep_. 1592.)\
\
Daniel was one of the most skilful of the Elizabethans in the use of the\
English form of the sonnet. The greater number of his _Sonnets to Delia_\
are of this type. The subject of the present sonnet was a fashionable\
one in the sixteenth century (compare Sidney's, quoted above).\
\
    Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,--\
    Nay I have done, you get no more of me;\
    And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,\
    That thus so cleanly I myself can free;\
    Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,\
    And when we meet at any time again,\
    Be it not seen in either of our brows\
    That we one jot of former love retain.\
    Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,\
    When, his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,\
    When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,\
    And innocence is closing up his eyes,\
    --Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over,\
    From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!\
\
(DRAYTON: _Love's Farewell_. 1594.)\
\
Rossetti called this sonnet "perhaps the best in the language."\
Drayton's sonnet-sequence, the _Idea_, follows the Shaksperian form; and\
the present specimen illustrates how the important division of this type\
of sonnet is between the quatrains and the final couplet.\
\
    One day I wrote her name upon the strand;\
    But came the waves and washed it away:\
    Again I wrote it with a second hand,\
    But came the tide and made my pains his prey.\
    Vain man! said she, that dost in vain essay\
    A mortal thing so to immortalize;\
    For I myself shall like to this decay,\
    And eke my name be wiped out likewise.\
    Not so (quoth I); let baser things devise\
    To die in dust, but you shall live by fame;\
    My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,\
    And in the heavens write your glorious name,--\
    Where, whenas death shall all the world subdue,\
    Our love shall live, and later life renew.\
\
(SPENSER: _Amoretti_, lxxv. 1595.)\
\
The sonnets in Spenser's collected poems number 177, of which fifty-six\
are in the common English (Surrey) form, the remainder--like the present\
specimen--riming _ababbcbccdcdee_. This order of rimes reminds us of\
that in the Spenserian stanza, and must have been devised by Spenser at\
about the same time. It has never been adopted by other poets.\
\
    When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\
    I all alone beweep my outcast state,\
    And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\
    And look upon myself and curse my fate;\
    Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,\
    Featured like him, like him with friends possest,\
    Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\
    With what I most enjoy contented least;\
    Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\
    Haply I think on thee--and then my state,\
    Like to the lark at break of day arising\
    From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\
    For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\
    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Sonnet_ xxix. 1609.)\
\
    That time of year thou may'st in me behold\
    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\
    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\
    Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang:\
    In me thou see'st the twilight of such day\
    As after sunset fadeth in the west,\
    Which by and by black night doth take away,\
    Death's second self, that seals up all in rest:\
    In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire\
    That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\
    As the death-bed whereon it must expire,\
    Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by:\
    --This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,\
    To love that well which thou must leave ere long.\
\
(SHAKSPERE: _Sonnet_ lxxiii. 1609.)\
\
These two specimens, perhaps the favorites of as many readers as any\
which could be chosen, must serve to represent the sonnets of Shakspere.\
The whole number of these is 154, and all are in the English form.\
Slight irregularities in the rime-scheme will be found in about fifteen.\
Number 99 has fifteen lines and 126 (sometimes called the Epilogue to\
the first part of the series) has only twelve. Number 20 is wholly based\
on feminine rimes.[38]\
\
    Lord, with what care hast Thou begirt us round!\
    Parents first season us; then schoolmasters\
    Deliver us to laws; they send us bound\
    To rules of reason, holy messengers,\
    Pulpits and Sundays, sorrow dogging sin,\
    Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes,\
    Fine nets and stratagems to catch us in,\
    Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,\
    Blessings beforehand, ties of gratefulness,\
    The sound of glory ringing in our ears;\
    Without, our shame; within, our consciences;\
    Angels and grace, eternal hopes and fears.\
    Yet all these fences and their whole array\
    One cunning bosom-sin blows quite away.\
\
(GEORGE HERBERT: _Sin_. 1631.)\
\
    In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,\
    And reddening Ph\'9cbus lifts his golden fire;\
    The birds in vain their amorous descant join,\
    Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.\
    These ears, alas! for other notes repine,\
    A different object do these eyes require;\
    My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine,\
    And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.\
    Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,\
    And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;\
    The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;\
    To warm their little loves the birds complain;\
    I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,\
    And weep the more because I weep in vain.\
\
(GRAY: _On the Death of Richard West_. 1742.)\
\
On the place of this sonnet in the eighteenth century, see p. 277,\
above.\
\
    Oh it is pleasant, with a heart at ease,\
    Just after sunset, or by moonlight skies,\
    To make the shifting clouds be what you please,\
    Or let the easily-persuaded eyes\
    Own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould\
    Of a friend's fancy; or, with head bent low\
    And cheek aslant, see rivers flow of gold\
    'Twixt crimson bank; and then, a traveler, go\
    From mount to mount through Cloudland, gorgeous land!\
    Or listening to the tide, with closed sight,\
    Be that blind bard who, on the Chian strand\
    By those deep sounds possessed with inward light,\
    Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee\
    Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea.\
\
(COLERIDGE: _Fancy in Nubibus_. 1819.)\
\
The sonnets of Coleridge, as has already been noted, were written under\
the influence of those of Bowles, and are not of the Italian type. He\
defined the sonnet as "a short poem in which some lonely feeling is\
developed," thus emphasizing, like Wordsworth, the idea of unity rather\
than of progressive structure.\
\
    Darkly, as by some gloomed mirror glassed,\
    Herein at times the brooding eye beholds\
    The great scarred visage of the pompous Past,\
    But oftener only the embroidered folds\
    And soiled regality of his rent robe,\
    Whose tattered skirts are ruined dynasties\
    And cumber with their trailing pride the globe,\
    And sweep the dusty ages in our eyes;\
    Till the world seems a world of husks and bones\
    Where sightless Seers and Immortals dead,\
    Kings that remember not their awful thrones,\
    Invincible armies long since vanquished,\
    And powerless potentates and foolish sages\
    Lie 'mid the crumbling of the mossy ages.\

FOOTNOTES:\
\
[35] It will perhaps be found of interest to reproduce the "Ten\
Commandments of the Sonnet" given by Mr. Sharp in his Introduction to\
_Sonnets of this Century_ (p. lxxviii):\
\
"1. The sonnet must consist of fourteen decasyllabic lines.\
\
"2. Its octave, or major system, whether or not this be marked by a\
pause in the cadence after the eighth line, must (unless cast in the\
Shakespearian mould) follow a prescribed arrangement in the\
rhyme-sounds--namely, the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth lines must\
rhyme on the same sound, and the second, third, sixth, and seventh on\
another.\
\
"3. Its sestet, or minor system, may be arranged with more freedom, but\
a rhymed couplet at the close is only allowable when the form is the\
English or Shakespearian.\
\
"4. No terminal should also occur in any other portion of any other line\
in the same system; and the rhyme-sounds (1) of the octave should be\
harmoniously at variance, and (2) the rhyme-sounds of the sestet should\
be entirely distinct in intonation from those of the octave....\
\
"5. It must have no slovenliness of diction, no weak or indeterminate\
terminations, no vagueness of conception, and no obscurity.\
\
"6. It must be absolutely complete in itself--_i.e._, it must be the\
evolution of one thought, or one emotion, or one poetically apprehended\
fact.\
\
"7. It should have the characteristic of apparent inevitableness, and in\
expression be ample, yet reticent....\
\
"8. The continuity of the thought, idea, or emotion must be unbroken\
throughout.\
\
"9. Continuous sonority must be maintained from the first phrase to the\
last.\
\
"10. The end must be more impressive than the commencement."\
\
These rules of course represent the ideal of the strictest Italian form,\
and are by no means derived from the prevailing practice of English\
poets.\

above; C. Tomlinson: _The Sonnet, its Origin, Structure, and Place in\
Poetry_ (1874); K. Lentzner: _Ueber das Sonett und seine Gestaltung in\
der englischen Dichtung bis Milton_ (1886); Leigh Hunt and S. A. Lee:\

[37] In 1575, when Gascoigne wrote his _Notes of Instruction_, he found\
it necessary to say: "Some thinke that all Poemes (being short) may be\
called Sonets, as in deede it is a diminutive worde derived of _Sonare_,\
but yet I can beste allowe to call those Sonnets whiche are of fouretene\
lynes, every line conteyning tenne syllables. The firste twelve do ryme\
in staves of foure lines by crosse meetre, and the last two ryming\
togither do conclude the whole." (Arber's Reprint, pp. 38, 39.) It is,\
of course, the English sonnet which Gascoigne thus describes.\
\
[38] Shakspere also introduced sonnets into some of his earlier plays:\
_Love's Labor's Lost_, _All's Well that Ends Well_, _Romeo and Juliet_,\
and _Henry V._ See Fleay's _Chronicle of the English Drama_, vol. ii. p.\
224, and Schelling's _Elizabethan Lyrics_, p. xxx.\
\
\
\
\
V. THE ODE\
\
\
The term Ode is used of English poetry with considerable vagueness. The\
Century Dictionary defines the word thus: "A lyric poem expressive of\
exalted or enthusiastic emotion, especially one of complex or irregular\
metrical form; originally and strictly, such a composition intended to\
be sung." Compare with this the definition of Mr. Gosse, in his\
collection of _English Odes_: "Any strain of enthusiastic and exalted\
lyrical verse, directed to a fixed purpose, and dealing progressively\
with one dignified theme."\
\
Viewed from the purely metrical standpoint, English odes are commonly\
either (_a_) regular Pindaric odes, imitative of the structure of the\
Greek ode, or (_b_) irregular, so-called "Pindaric" or "Cowleyan" odes.\
A third group may be made of forms based on the imitation of the choral\
odes of the Greek drama. There is also a class of odes called\
"Horatian," made up of simple lyrical stanzas; the name "ode" is applied\
here only because of the content of the poem or because of resemblance\
to the so-called odes (properly _carmina_ or songs) of Horace, and since\
these Horatian odes show no metrical peculiarities they will not be\
represented here.[39]\
\
The characteristic effect of the ode is produced by the varying lengths\
of lines employed, and the varying distances at which the rimes answer\
one another. This variety, in the hands of a master of verse, is capable\
of splendid effectiveness, but it gives dangerous license to the\
unskilled writer.\

\
        It is not growing like a tree\
        In bulk, doth make men better be;\
    Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,\
    To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear:\
              A lily of a day\
              Is fairer far, in May,\
        Although it fall and die that night;\
        It was the plant of flower and light.\
    In small proportions we just beauties see;\
    And in short measures life may perfect be.\

\

    And think, nay know, thy Morison's not dead.\
            He leap'd the present age,\
            Possess'd with holy rage,\
        To see that bright eternal day;\
        Of which we priests and poets say\
    Such truths as we expect for happy men:\
    And there he lives with memory, and Ben.\

              To have express'd,\
            In this bright asterism!--\
            Where it were friendship's schism,\
        Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry,\
                To separate these twi-\
                Lights, the Dioscuri;\
        And keep the one half from his Harry.\
    But fate doth so alternate the design,\
    Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.\
\
(BEN JONSON: _A Pindaric Ode on the death of Sir H. Morison_. 1629.)\
\
This ode of Jonson's is apparently the earliest, and remained for a long\
time the only, notable English ode based on the strict structure of the\
Greek original. The Greek ode was commonly divided into the strophe, the\
antistrophe, and the epode; the strophe and antistrophe being identical\
in structure, though varying in different odes, and the epode being of\
different structure. Jonson therefore followed the classical form\
carefully, and introduced English terms to express the original three\
divisions.\
\
Professor Bronson observes, in his Introduction to the Odes of Collins:\
"It is a commonplace that the Pindaric Ode in English is an artificial\
exotic, of slight native force, and unable to reproduce the effects of\
the Greek original. The reason is obvious. The Greek odes were\
accompanied by music and dancing, the singers moving to one side during\
the strophe, retracing their steps during the antistrophe, ... and\
standing still during the epode. The ear was thus helped by the eye, and\
the divisions of the ode were distinct and significant. But in an\
English Pindaric the elaborate correspondences and differences between\
strophe, antistrophe, and epode are lost upon most readers, and even the\
critical reader derives from them a pleasure intellectual rather than\
sensuous." (Edition of Collins, Athen\'e6um Press Series, Introduction, pp.\
lxxiv, lxxv.)\

\
(CONGREVE: _A Pindaric Ode on the victorious progress of her Majesty's\
Arms_. 1706.)\
\
To Congreve is due the credit for the revival of the regular ode in the\
eighteenth century, after it had been long forgotten by English poets.\
Meantime the irregular form, devised by Cowley, had become popular; and\
against the license of this Congreve protested in his _Discourse on the\
Pindaric Ode_, prefixed to his Ode of 1706. (See Mr. Gosse's\
Introduction to _English Odes_, p. xvii., and his _Life of Congreve_, p.\
158.)\
\
     Congreve said in his Discourse: "The following ode is an attempt\
     towards restoring the regularity of the ancient lyric poetry, which\
     seems to be altogether forgotten, or unknown, by our English\
     writers. There is nothing more frequent among us than a sort of\
     poems entitled Pindaric Odes, pretending to be written in imitation\
     of the manner and style of Pindar, and yet I do not know that there\
     is to this day extant, in our language, one ode contrived after his\
     model.... The character of these late Pindarics is a bundle of\
     rambling incoherent thoughts, expressed in a like parcel of\
     irregular stanzas, which also consist of such another complication\
     of disproportioned, uncertain, and perplexed verses and rhymes....\
     On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the odes of\
     Pindar, both as to the exact observation of the measures and\
     numbers of his stanzas and verses, and the perpetual coherence of\
     his thoughts....\
\
     "Though there be no necessity that our triumphal odes should\
     consist of the three afore-mentioned stanzas, yet if the reader can\
     observe that the great variation of the numbers in the third stanza\
     (call it epode, or what you please) has a pleasing effect in the\
     ode, and makes him return to the first and second stanzas with more\
     appetite than he could do if always cloyed with the same quantities\
     and measures, I cannot see why some use may not be made of Pindar's\
     example, to the great improvement of the English ode. There is\
     certainly a pleasure in beholding anything that has art and\
     difficulty in the contrivance, especially if it appears so\
     carefully executed that the difficulty does not show itself till it\
     is sought for....\
\
     "Having mentioned Mr. Cowley, it may very well be expected that\
     something should be said of him, at a time when the imitation of\
     Pindar is the theme of our discourse. But there is that great\
     deference due to the memory, great parts, and learning, of that\
     gentleman, that I think nothing should be objected to the latitude\
     he has taken in his Pindaric odes. The beauty of his verses is an\
     atonement for the irregularity of his stanzas.... Yet I must beg\
     leave to add that I believe those irregular odes of Mr. Cowley may\
     have been the principal, though innocent, occasion of so many\
     deformed poems since, which, instead of being true pictures of\
     Pindar, have (to use the Italian painters' term) been only\
     caricatures of him."\

      Who shall awake the Spartan fife,\
      And call in solemn sounds to life\
    The youths whose locks divinely spreading,\
      Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue,\

      Applauding Freedom lov'd of old to view?\
        What new Alc\'e6us, fancy-blest,\

      At Wisdom's shrine awhile its flame concealing\
    (What place so fit to seal a deed renowned?),\
      Till she her brightest lightnings round revealing,\
    It leap'd in glory forth, and dealt her prompted wound?\

      When Time his Northern sons of spoil awoke,\
      And all the blended work of strength and grace,\
          With many a rude repeated stroke,\
    And many a barb'rous yell, to thousand fragments broke....\

      No sea between, nor cliff sublime and hoary,\
        He pass'd with unwet feet thro' all our land.\
            To the blown Baltic then, they say,\
            The wild waves found another way,\
        Where Orcas howls, his wolfish mountains rounding;\
      Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise,\
        A wide wild storm ev'n Nature's self confounding,\
      With'ring her giant sons with strange uncouth surprise.\
            This pillar'd earth so firm and wide,\
            By winds and inward labors torn,\
            In thunders dread was push'd aside,\
            And down the should'ring billows borne.\
            And see, like gems, her laughing train,\
            The little isles on every side!\
      Mona, once hid from those who search the main,\
            Where thousand elfin shapes abide,\
            And Wight, who checks the west'ring tide;\
      For thee consenting Heaven has each bestowed,\
      A fair attendant on her sovereign pride.\
            To thee this blest divorce she ow'd,\
    For thou hast made her vales thy lov'd, thy last abode!\
\
(COLLINS: _Ode to Liberty_, strophe and antistrophe. 1746.)\
\
This ode consists of strophe, epode, antistrophe, and second epode. The\
antistrophe corresponds metrically to the strophe, as usual; the epodes\
are in four-stress couplets. It was Collins's habit to place the epode\
between the strophe and antistrophe, perhaps, as Professor Bronson\
suggests, in order that it may produce "an impression of its own\
analogous to that of the Greek epode, namely, an impression of relief\
and repose." Mr. Bronson says further of Collins's odes: "Collins was\
less scholarly than Gray, but he was bolder and more original; and\
consciously or unconsciously he so constructed his odes that their\
organic parts stand out clearly distinct and produce effects analogous\
to those produced by the Greek ode. In brief, his method was, first, to\
make large divisions of the thought correspond to the large divisions of\
the form; and, second, to throw out into relief the complex strophe and\
antistrophe by contrasting them with a simple epode. The reader may not\
perceive the minute correspondences in form between strophe and\
antistrophe, but he can hardly fail to feel that the two answer to one\
another in a general way." (Athen\'e6um Press edition of Collins,\
Introduction, p. lxxv.)\

\
(GRAY: _The Progress of Poesy._ 1757.)\
\
Gray's _Progress of Poesy_ is probably to be regarded as the chief of\
all English odes of the regular Pindaric form. Mr. Lowell said, indeed,\
that it "overflies all other English lyrics like an eagle." _The Bard_\
is in precisely the same form, and shows the same skill in the wielding\
of the intricately varying melodies of the lines of different length.\

            Whom thunder's dismal noise,\
        And all that Prophets and Apostles louder spake,\
        And all the creatures' plain conspiring voice,\
          Could not, whilst they liv'd, awake,\
          This mightier sound shall make\
              When dead t' arise,\
          And open tombs, and open eyes,\
        To the long sluggards of five thousand years.\
      This mightier sound shall wake its hearers' ears.\
      Then shall the scatter'd atoms crowding come\
          Back to their ancient home.\
        Some from birds, from fishes some,\
        Some from earth, and some from seas,\
        Some from beasts, and some from trees.\
        Some descend from clouds on high,\
        Some from metals upwards fly,\
    And where th' attending soul naked and shivering stands,\
        Meet, salute, and join their hands,\
      As dispers'd soldiers at the trumpet's call\
              Haste to their colors all.\
          Unhappy most, like tortur'd men,\

          Kindled at a hint so great.\
    Hold thy Pindaric Pegasus closely in,\
          Which does to rage begin,\
    And this steep hill would gallop up with violent course;\
    'Tis an unruly and a hard-mouth'd horse,\
          Fierce, and unbroken yet,\
          Impatient of the spur or bit;\
    Now prances stately, and anon flies o'er the place;\
    Disdains the servile law of any settled pace;\
    Conscious and proud of his own natural force,\
          'Twill no unskilful touch endure,\
    But flings writer and reader too that sits not sure.\
\
(COWLEY: _The Resurrection_, strophes iii. and iv. 1656).\
\
Cowley, as has already appeared, introduced the irregular ode into\
English poetry, calling it "Pindaric" under a misapprehension of the\
real structure of the Greek odes. He published fifteen "Pindarique Odes"\
in 1656 (see the Preface to these, in Grosart's edition of his works,\
vol. ii. p. 4). The present specimen illustrates the really not\
unskilful use which Cowley made of the varying cadences of the form, and\
also sets forth--in the amusing concluding lines--his own idea of its\
difficulties.\
\
Under the influence of Cowley's odes, the new form speedily became\
popular. According to Dr. Johnson, "this lax and lawless versification\
so much concealed the deficiencies of the barren, and flattered the\
laziness of the idle, that it immediately over-spread our books of\
poetry; all the boys and girls caught the pleasing fashion, and they who\
could do nothing else could write like Pindar." (_Life of Cowley_.)\
Compare also the remarks of Mr. Gosse: "Until the days of Collins and\
Gray, the ode modelled upon Cowley was not only the universal medium for\
congratulatory lyrics and pompous occasional pieces, but it was almost\
the only variety permitted to the melancholy generations over whom the\
heroic couplet reigned supreme." (_Seventeenth Century Studies_, p.\
216.)\
\
It has been the habit of modern critics to treat the irregularities of\
the Cowleyan ode with no little contempt, and it is undoubtedly true\
that in the hands of small poets its liberties are dangerous; but it is\
also true that some of the greatest modern poets have adopted the form\
for some of their best work, and that they have generally preferred it\
to that of the regular Pindaric ode.\
\
    When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound,\
      To raise the nations under ground;\
      When in the valley of Jehoshaphat\
    The judging God shall close the book of Fate,\
      And there the last assizes keep\
      For those who wake and those who sleep;\
      When rattling bones together fly\
      From the four corners of the sky;\
    When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,\
    Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the dead;\
    The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,\
    And foremost from the tomb shall bound,\
    For they are covered with the lightest ground;\
    And straight, with inborn vigor, on the wing,\
    Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.\
    There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shalt go,\
    As harbinger of heaven, the way to show,\
    The way which thou so well hast learn'd below.\
\
(DRYDEN: _To the Pious Memory of Mistress Anne Killigrew_, strophe x.\
1686.)\
\
See also specimen from the _Ode for St. Cecilia's Day_, quoted above, p.\
52.\
\
Dryden's odes for St. Cecilia's Day (especially the _Alexander's Feast_)\
are among the most highly esteemed of his poems; but parts, at least, of\
the ode on Mistress Killigrew are no less fine, and in this case we have\
a purely literary ode, whose irregularities are not designed--as in the\
case of the others--to fit choral rendering. The conclusion of the ode,\
here quoted, seems to owe something of both substance and form to the\
conclusion of Cowley's Resurrection Ode (see preceding specimen). Dr.\
Johnson called Dryden's Killigrew Ode "undoubtedly the noblest ode that\
our language ever has produced."\
\
      Last came Joy's ecstatic trial.\
      He, with viny crown advancing,\
        First to the lively pipe his hand addrest;\
      But soon he saw the brisk awak'ning viol,\
        Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best.\
        They would have thought, who heard the strain,\
        They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids,\
        Amidst the festal sounding shades,\
    To some unwearied minstrel dancing,\
      While, as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings,\
        Love fram'd with Mirth a gay fantastic round;\
        Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound,\
          And he, amidst his frolic play,\
      As if he would the charming air repay,\
      Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings.\

        Stunned by Death's twice mortal mace,\

      Ye that gasped on Warsaw's plain!\
      Ye that erst at Ismail's tower,\

    Mid women's shrieks and infants' screams!\
      Spirits of the uncoffined slain,\
          Sudden blasts of triumph swelling,\
      Oft, at night, in misty train,\
          Rush around her narrow dwelling!\
    The exterminating fiend is fled--\
      (Foul her life, and dark her doom)--\
    Mighty armies of the dead\
      Dance, like death-fires, round her tomb!\
        Then with prophetic song relate\
        Each some tyrant-murderer's fate!\
\
(COLERIDGE: _Ode on the Departing Year_, strophe iii. 1796.)\
\
This ode was evidently intended to be in the regular Pindaric form, and\
was divided into strophes, antistrophes, and epodes; but it soon broke\
into irregularity. On Coleridge's odes see some remarks by Mr. Theodore\
Watts in the article on Poetry in the _Encyclop\'e6dia Britannica_.\
\
    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\
    The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\
        Hath had elsewhere its setting,\
          And cometh from afar:\
        Not in entire forgetfulness,\
        And not in utter nakedness,\
    But trailing clouds of glory do we come\
          From God, who is our home.\
    Heaven lies about us in our infancy!\
    Shades of the prison-house begin to close\
          Upon the growing boy,\
    But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,\
          He sees it in his joy;\
    The youth, who daily farther from the east\
        Must travel, still is Nature's priest,\
          And by the vision splendid\
          Is on his way attended;\
    At length the man perceives it die away,\
    And fade into the light of common day....\
          O joy! that in our embers\
            Is something that doth live,\
          That nature yet remembers\
            What was so fugitive!\
    The thought of our past years in me doth breed\
    Perpetual benediction: not indeed\
    For that which is most worthy to be blest;\
    Delight and liberty, the simple creed\
    Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,\
    With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:--\
          Not for these I raise\
          The song of thanks and praise;\
        But for those obstinate questionings\
        Of sense and outward things,\
        Fallings from us, vanishings;\
          Blank misgivings of a creature\
    Moving about in worlds not realized,\
    High instincts before which our mortal nature\
    Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:\
          But for those first affections,\
          Those shadowy recollections,\
        Which, be they what they may,\
    Are yet the fountain light of all our day,\
    Are yet a master light of all our seeing;\
        Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make\
    Our noisy years seem moments in the being\
    Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake\
            To perish never;\
    Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor,\
            Nor man nor boy,\
    Nor all that is at enmity with joy,\
    Can utterly abolish or destroy!\
        Hence in a season of calm weather,\
          Though inland far we be,\
    Our souls have sight of that immortal sea\
            Which brought us hither,\
        Can in a moment travel thither,\
    And see the children sport upon the shore,\
    And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: _Intimations of Immortality_, strophes v. and ix. 1807.)\
\
In this poem the English ode may be said to have reached its high-water\
mark. Professor Corson observes: "The several metres are felt, in the\
course of the reading of the Ode, to be organic--inseparable from what\
each is employed to express. The rhymes, too, with their varying\
degrees of emphasis, according to the nearness or remoteness, and the\
length, of the rhyming verses, are equally a part of the expression....\
The feelings of the reader of English poetry get to be set, so to speak,\
to the pentameter measure, as in that measure the largest portion of\
English poetry is written; and, accordingly, other measures derive some\
effect from that fact. In the theme-metre, generally, the more\
reflective portions of the Ode, its deeper tones, are expressed. The\
gladder notes come in the shorter metres.... Wordsworth never wrote any\
poem of which it can be more truly said than of his great Ode, 'Of the\
soul the body form doth take.'" (_Primer of English Verse_, pp. 32-34.)\
\
          Then gentle winds arose\
          With many a mingled close\
    Of wild \'c6olian sound and mountain-odor keen;\
          And where the Baian ocean\
          Welters with airlike motion,\
    Within, above, around its bowers of starry green,\
    Moving the sea-flowers in those purple caves\
      Even as the ever stormless atmosphere\
        Floats o'er the Elysian realm,\
    It bore me like an Angel, o'er the waves\
      Of sunlight, whose swift pinnace of dewy air\
          No storm can overwhelm;\
          I sailed, where ever flows\
          Under the calm Serene\
          A spirit of deep emotion\
          From the unknown graves\
          Of the dead kings of Melody.\
    Shadowy Aornos darkened o'er the helm\
    The horizontal ether; heaven stripped bare\
    Its depths over Elysium, where the prow\
      Made the invisible water white as snow;\
      From that Typh\'e6an mount, Inarime,\
    There streamed a sunlight vapor, like the standard\
          Of some ethereal host;\
          Whilst from the coast,\
    Louder and louder, gathering round, there wandered\
    Over the oracular woods and divine sea\
    Prophesyings which grew articulate--\
    They seize me--I must speak them--be they fate!\
\
(SHELLEY: _Ode to Naples_, strophe ii. 1819.)\
\
    Bury the Great Duke\
    With an empire's lamentation,\
    Let us bury the Great Duke\
    To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation,\
    Mourning when their leaders fall,\
    Warriors carry the warrior's pall,\
    And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall.\
    Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?\
    Here, in streaming London's central roar.\
    Let the sound of those he wrought for,\
    And the feet of those he fought for,\
    Echo round his bones for evermore.\
\
    Lead out the pageant: sad and slow,\
    As fits an universal woe,\
    Let the long long procession go,\
    And let the sorrowing crowd about it grow,\
    And let the mournful martial music blow;\
    The last great Englishman is low....\
\
    ... We revere, and while we hear\
    The tides of Music's golden sea\
    Setting toward eternity,\
    Uplifted high in heart and hope are we,\
    Until we doubt not that for one so true\
    There must be other nobler work to do\
    Than when he fought at Waterloo,\
    And Victor he must ever be.\
    For though the Giant Ages heave the hill\
    And break the shore, and evermore\
    Make and break, and work their will;\
    Though world on world in myriad myriads roll\
    Round us, each with different powers,\
    And other forms of life than ours,\
    What know we greater than the soul?\
    On God and Godlike men we build our trust.\
    Hush, the Dead March wails in the people's ears:\
    The dark crowd moves, and there are sobs and tears:\
    The black earth yawns: the mortal disappears;\
    Ashes to ashes, dust to dust;\
    He is gone who seemed so great.--\
    Gone; but nothing can bereave him\
    Of the force he made his own\
    Being here, and we believe him\
    Something far advanced in state,\
    And that he wears a truer crown\
    Than any wreath that man can weave him.\
    Speak no more of his renown,\
    Lay your earthly fancies down,\
    And in the vast cathedral leave him.\
    God accept him, Christ receive him.\
\
(TENNYSON: _On the Death of the Duke of Wellington_, strophes i, ii,\
iii, ix (in part). 1852.)\
\
This ode of Tennyson's is one of the few poems in which he gave himself\
such liberty of form (compare some of the irregular measures of _Maud_).\
It shows his usual skill in the adaptation of metrical effects to the\
purposes of description. Dr. Henry Van Dyke has suggested that the\
varying--almost lawless--movements of the opening lines are designed to\
suggest the surging of the crowd through the streets of London, before\
the entrance into the cathedral for the funeral.\
\
    Bow down, dear Land, for thou hast found release!\
        Thy God, in these distempered days,\
      Hath taught thee the sure wisdom of His ways,\
    And through thine enemies hath wrought thy peace!\
          Bow down in prayer and praise!\
      No poorest in thy borders but may now\
    Lift to the juster skies a man's enfranchised brow.\
      O Beautiful! my Country! ours once more,\
      Smoothing thy gold of war-dishevelled hair\
      O'er such sweet brows as never other wore,\
          And letting thy set lips,\
          Freed from wrath's pale eclipse,\
      The rosy edges of their smile lay bare,\
      What words divine of lover or of poet\
      Could tell our love and make thee know it,\
      Among the Nations bright beyond compare?\
          What were our lives without thee?\
          What all our lives to save thee?\
          We reck not what we gave thee;\
          We will not dare to doubt thee.\
      But ask whatever else, and we will dare!\
\
(LOWELL: _Harvard Commemoration Ode_, strophe xii. 1865.)\
\
This is undoubtedly the finest of odes by American poets, and remains\
one of the glories of new-world poetry. Its irregular measures were\
designed by Mr. Lowell to fit the poem for public reading (see his\
letter to Mr. Gosse on the subject, quoted in the Appendix to Gosse's\
_Seventeenth Century Studies_).\
\
    In the Year of the great Crime,\
    When the false English nobles and their Jew,\
    By God demented, slew\
    The Trust they stood thrice pledged to keep from wrong,\
    One said, Take up thy Song,\
    That breathes the mild and almost mythic time\
    Of England's prime!\
    But I, Ah, me,\
    The freedom of the few\
    That, in our free Land, were indeed the free,\
    Can song renew?\
    Ill singing 'tis with blotting prison-bars,\
    How high soe'er, betwixt us and the stars;\
    Ill singing 'tis when there are none to hear;\
    And days are near\
    When England shall forget\
    The fading glow which, for a little while,\
    Illumes her yet,\
    The lovely smile\
    That grows so faint and wan,\
    Her people shouting in her dying ear:\
    Are not jays twain worth two of any swan!\
    Harsh words and brief asks the dishonor'd Year.\
\
(COVENTRY PATMORE: Ode ix. Printed 1868.)\
\
Mr. Patmore's use of the irregular ode forms is of particular interest.\
He made a special study of the form, and applied it more widely than is\
commonly done. His first odes were printed (not published) in 1868, and\
from one of these the present specimen is taken. Later (1877), in\
connection with _The Unknown Eros_, he set forth his view of the ode\
form, treating it not as lawless but as governed by laws of its own.\
"Nearly all English metres," he said, "owe their existence as metres to\
'catalexis,' or pause, for the time of one or more feet, and, as a rule,\
the position and amount of catalexis, are fixed. But the verse in which\
this volume is written is catalectic _par excellence_, employing the\
pause (as it does the rhyme) with freedom only limited by the exigencies\
of poetic passion. From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own,\
some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the\
wings of this verse; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less\
discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts, on the part\
sometimes of considerable poets, to adapt it to purposes with which it\
has no expressional correspondence; or to vary it by rhythmical\
movements which are destructive of its character. Some persons,\
unlearned in the subject of this metre, have objected to this kind of\
verse that it is 'lawless.' But it has its laws as truly as any other.\
In its highest order, the lyric or 'ode,' it is a tetrameter, the line\
having the time of eight iambics. When it descends to narrative, or the\
expression of a less exalted strain of thought, it becomes a trimeter,\
having the time of six iambics, or even a dimeter, with the time of\
four; and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter 'ode' by the occasional\
introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures,\
but not, I think, by the use of any other. The license to rhyme at\
indefinite intervals is counterbalanced ... by unusual frequency in the\
recurrence of the same rhyme." (From Patmore's Prefatory Note to _The\
Unknown Eros_; quoted by William Sharp, in the Introduction to _Great\
Odes_, p. xxxii.)[40]\
\
      On the shores of a Continent cast,\
        She won the inviolate soil\
    By loss of heirdom of all the Past,\
    And faith in the royal right of Toil!\
    She planted homes on the savage sod:\
      Into the wilderness lone\
      She walked with fearless feet,\
      In her hand the divining-rod,\
      Till the veins of the mountains beat\
    With fire of metal and force of stone!\
    She set the speed of the river-head\
        To turn the mills of her bread;\
        She drove her ploughshare deep\
    Through the prairie's thousand-centuried sleep.\
        To the South, and West, and North,\
          She called Pathfinder forth,\
        Her faithful and sole companion\
    Where the flushed Sierra, snow-starred,\
        Her way to the sunset barred,\
    And the nameless rivers in thunder and foam\
        Channeled the terrible canyon!\
      Nor paused, till her uttermost home\
    Was built, in the smile of a softer sky\
      And the glory of beauty yet to be,\
    Where the haunted waves of Asia die\
      On the strand of the world-wide sea.\
\
(BAYARD TAYLOR: _National Ode_, strophe iii. 1876.)\
\
    Soon shall the Cape Ann children shout in glee,\
    Spying the arbutus, spring's dear recluse;\
    Hill lads at dawn shall hearken the wild goose\
    Go honking northward over Tennessee;\
    West from Oswego to Sault Sainte-Marie,\
    And on to where the Pictured Rocks are hung,\
    And yonder where, gigantic, willful, young,\
    Chicago sitteth at the northwest gates,\
    With restless violent hands and casual tongue\
    Moulding her mighty fates,\
    The Lakes shall robe them in ethereal sheen;\
    And like a larger sea, the vital green\
    Of springing wheat shall vastly be outflung\
    Over Dakota and the prairie states.\
    By desert people immemorial\
    On Arizonan mesas shall be done\
    Dim rites unto the thunder and the sun;\
    Nor shall the primal gods lack sacrifice\
    More splendid, when the white Sierras call\
    Unto the Rockies straightway to arise\
    And dance before the unveiled ark of the year,\
    Sounding their windy cedars as for shawms,\
    Unrolling rivers clear\
    For flutter of broad phylacteries;\
    While Shasta signals to Alaskan seas\
    That watch old sluggish glaciers downward creep\
    To fling their icebergs thundering from the steep,\
    And Mariposa through the purple calms\
    Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms\
    Where East and West are met,--\
    A rich seal on the ocean's bosom set\
    To say that East and West are twain,\
    With different loss and gain:\
    The Lord hath sundered them; let them be sundered yet....\
\
    ... Ah no!\
    We have not fallen so,\
    We are our fathers' sons: let those who lead us know!\
    'Twas only yesterday sick Cuba's cry\
    Came up the tropic wind, 'Now help us, for we die!'\
    Then Alabama heard,\
    And rising, pale, to Maine and Idaho\
    Shouted a burning word.\
    Proud state with proud impassioned state conferred,\
    And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth,\
    East, west, and south, and north,\
    Beautiful armies. Oh, by the sweet blood and young,\
    Shed on the awful hill slope at San Juan,\
    By the unforgotten names of eager boys\
    Who might have tasted girls' love and been stung\
    With the old mystic joys\
    And starry griefs, now the spring nights come on,\
    But that the heart of youth is generous,--\
    We charge you, ye who lead us,\
    Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain!\
    Turn not their new-world victories to gain!\
    One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays\
    Of their dear praise,\
    One jot of their pure conquest put to hire,\
    The implacable republic will require.\
\
(WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY: _An Ode in Time of Hesitation_, strophes iii. and\
ix. 1900.)\
\
\
C.--CHORAL\
\
Different from either of the two classes of odes already represented are\
the irregular choral measures used by a few English poets in translation\
or imitation of the odes of the Greek drama.\
\
_Chorus._\
\
    O dearly bought revenge, yet glorious!\
    Living or dying thou hast fulfilled\
    The work for which thou wast foretold\
    To Israel, and now liest victorious\
    Among thy slain self-killed;\
    Not willingly, but tangled in the fold\
    Of dire Necessity, whose law in death conjoined\
    Thee with thy slaughtered foes, in number more\
    Than all thy life had slain before.\
\
_Semi-chorus._\
\
    While their hearts were jocund and sublime,\
    Drunk with idolatry, drunk with wine\
    And fat regorged of bulls and goats,\
    Chaunting their idol, and preferring\
    Before our living Dread, who dwells\
    In Silo, his bright sanctuary,\
    Among them he a spirit of phrenzy sent,\
    Who hurt their minds,\
    And urged them on with mad desire\
    To call in haste for their destroyer.\
    They, only set on sport and play,\
    Unweetingly importuned\
    Their own destruction to come speedy upon them.\
    So fond are mortal men,\
    Fallen into wrath divine,\
    As their own ruin on themselves to invite,\
    Insensate left, or to sense reprobate,\
    And with blindness internal struck.\
\
_Semi-chorus._\
\
    But he, though blind of sight,\
    Despised, and thought extinguished quite,\
    With inward eyes illuminated,\
    His fiery virtue roused\
    From under ashes into sudden flame,\
    And as an evening dragon came,\
    Assailant on the perched roosts\
    And nests in order ranged\
    Of tame villatic fowl, but as an eagle\
    His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.\
    So Virtue, given for lost,\
    Depressed and overthrown, as seemed,\
    Like that self-begotten bird\
    In the Arabian woods embost,\
    That no second knows nor third,\
    And lay erewhile a holocaust,\
    From out her ashy womb now teemed,\
    Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most\
    When most unactive deemed;\
    And, though her body die, her fame survives,\
    A secular bird, ages of lives.\
\
(MILTON: _Samson Agonistes_, ll. 1660-1707. 1671.)\
\
Of this passage Mr. Swinburne says: "It is hard to realize and hopeless\
to reproduce the musical force of classic metres so recondite and\
exquisite as the choral parts of a Greek play. Even Milton could not;\
though with his godlike instinct and his godlike might of hand he made a\
kind of strange and enormous harmony by intermixture of assonance and\
rhyme with irregular blank verse, as in that last Titanic chorus of\
Samson which utters over the fallen Philistines the trumpet-blast and\
thunder of its triumphs." (_Essays and Studies_, pp. 162, 163.)\
\
    The lyre's voice is lovely everywhere;\
    In the court of gods, in the city of men,\
    And in the lonely rock-strewn mountain-glen,\
    In the still mountain air.\
    Only to Typho it sounds hatefully,--\
    To Typho only, the rebel o'erthrown,\
    Through whose heart Etna drives her roots of stone,\
    To embed them in the sea.\
    Wherefore dost thou groan so loud?\
    Wherefore do thy nostrils flash,\
    Through the dark night, suddenly,\
    Typho, such red jets of flame?\
    Is thy tortured heart still proud?\
    Is thy fire-scathed arm still rash?\
    Still alert thy stone-crushed frame?\
    Doth thy fierce soul still deplore\
    Thine ancient rout by the Cilician hills,\
    And that curst treachery on the Mount of Gore?\
    Do thy bloodshot eyes still weep\
    The fight which crowned thine ills,\
    Thy last mischance on this Sicilian deep?\
    Hast thou sworn, in thy sad lair,\
    Where erst the strong sea-currents sucked thee down,\
    Never to cease to writhe, and try to rest,\
    Letting the sea-stream wander through thy hair?\
    That thy groans, like thunder prest,\
    Begin to roll, and almost drown\
    The sweet notes whose lulling spell\
    Gods and the race of mortals love so well,\
    When through thy caves thou hearest music swell?\
\
    But an awful pleasure bland\
    Spreading o'er the Thunderer's face,\
    When the sound climbs near his seat,\
    The Olympian council sees;\
    As he lets his lax right hand,\
    Which the lightnings doth embrace,\
    Sink upon his mighty knees.\
    And the eagle, at the beck\
    Of the appeasing, gracious harmony,\
    Droops all his sheeny, brown, deep-feathered neck,\
    Nestling nearer to Jove's feet;\
    While o'er his sovran eye\
    The curtains of the blue films slowly meet.\
    And the white Olympus-peaks\
    Rosily brighten, and the soothed gods smile\
    At one another from their golden chairs,\
    And no one round the charmed circle speaks.\
    Only the loved Hebe bears\
    The cup about, whose draughts beguile\
    Pain and care, with a dark store\
    Of fresh-pulled violets wreathed and nodding o'er;\
    And her flushed feet glow on the marble floor.\
\
(MATTHEW ARNOLD: _Empedocles on Etna_, Act II. Song of Callicles. 1853.)\
\
    Wherefore to me, this fear--\
    Groundedly stationed here\
    Fronting my heart, the portent-watcher--flits she?\
    Wherefore should prophet-play\
    The uncalled and unpaid lay,\
    Nor--having spat forth fear, like bad dreams--sits she\
    On the mind's throne beloved--well-suasive Boldness?\
    For time, since, by a throw of all the hands,\
    The boat's stern-cables touched the sands,\
    Has passed from youth to oldness,--\
    When under Ilion rushed the ship-borne bands.\
\
    And from my eyes I learn--\
    Being myself my witness--their return.\
    Yet, all the same, without a lyre, my soul,\
    Itself its teacher too, chants from within\
    Erinus' dirge, not having now the whole\
    Of Hope's dear boldness: nor my inwards sin--\
    The heart that's rolled in whirls against the mind\
    Justly presageful of a fate behind.\
    But I pray--things false, from my hope, may fall\
    Into the fate that's not-fulfilled-at-all!\
\
    Especially at least, of health that's great\
    The term's insatiable: for, its weight\
    --A neighbor, with a common wall between--\
    Ever will sickness lean;\
    And destiny, her course pursuing straight,\
    Has struck man's ship against a reef unseen.\
    Now, when a portion, rather than the treasure\
    Fear casts from sling, with peril in right measure,\
    It has not sunk--the universal freight,\
    (With misery freighted over-full,)\
    Nor has fear whelmed the hull.\
    Then too the gift of Zeus,\
    Two-handedly profuse,\
    Even from the furrows' yield for yearly use\
    Has done away with famine, the disease;\
    But blood of man to earth once falling,--deadly, black,--\
    In times ere these,--\
    Who may, by singing spells, call back?\
    Zeus had not else stopped one who rightly knew\
    The way to bring the dead again.\
    But, did not an appointed Fate constrain\
    The Fate from gods, to bear no more than due,\
    My heart, outstripping what tongue utters,\
    Would have all out: which now, in darkness, mutters\
    Moodily grieved, nor ever hopes to find\
    How she a word in season may unwind\
    From out the enkindling mind.\
\
(BROWNING: _Agamemnon_; chorus. 1877.)\
\
Of the same general metrical character as the irregular odes are certain\
poems (like some of Patmore's) with no regularly organized structure and\
varying lengths of line. See, for example, Milton's verses _At a Solemn\
Music_ and _On Time_; Swinburne's _Thalassius_ and _On the Cliffs_; and\
William Morris's _On a fair Spring Morning_. Compare, also, the effect\
of the irregular strophic forms in Southey's _Curse of Kehama_,\
Shelley's _Queen Mab_, and the like.[41]\
\
\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[39] On English ode-forms, see the introductions to Mr. Gosse's _English\
Odes_ and Mr. William Sharp's _Great Odes_; also Schipper, vol. ii. p.\

\
[40] Mr. Patmore has used the same sort of verse for narrative poetry,\
with unusual daring but also with unusual success. For an example see\
his _Amelia_, included in the _Golden Treasury_, Second Series. The\
following passage exhibits the metrical method of the poem at its best:\
\
"And so we went alone By walls o'er which the lilac's numerous plume\
Shook down perfume; Trim plots close blown With daisies, in conspicuous\
myriads seen, Engross'd each one With single ardor for her spouse, the\
sun; Garths in their glad array Of white and ruddy branch, auroral, gay,\
With azure chill the maiden flower between; Meadows of fervid green,\
With sometime sudden prospect of untold Cowslips, like chance-found\
gold; And broadcast buttercups at joyful gaze, Rending the air with\
praise, Like the six-hundred-thousand-voiced shout Of Jacob camp'd in\
Midian put to rout; Then through the Park, Where Spring to livelier\
gloom Quickened the cedars dark, And, 'gainst the clear sky cold, Which\
shone afar Crowded with sunny alps oracular, Great chestnuts raised\
themselves abroad like cliffs of bloom."\
\
\
\
[41] The easy abuse of these irregular measures is amusingly parodied by\
Mr. Owen Seaman, in a burlesque of an ode of Mr. Le Gallienne's:\
\
"Is this the Seine? And am I altogether wrong About the brain, Dreaming\
I hear the British tongue? Dear Heaven! what a rhyme! And yet 'tis all\
as good As some that I have fashioned in my time, Like _bud_ and _wood_;\
And on the other hand you couldn't have a more precise or neater Metre."\

\
VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES\
\
\
While English verse is generally admitted to be based on a different\
system from that of Greek and Latin poetry (the element of accent\
obscuring that of quantity in English prosody, as the element of\
quantity obscures that of accent in classical prosody), there have been\
repeated attempts to introduce the more familiar classical measures into\
English. Most of these attempts have been academic and have attracted\
the attention only of critics and scholars; a few have interested the\
reading public.\
\
Imitations of classical verse in English may conveniently be divided\
into two classes: imitations of lyrical measures, and imitations of the\
dactylic hexameter. The latter group is of course much the larger,\
especially in modern poetry. It will appear that the classical measures\
might also be divided into two groups according to another distinction:\
those attempting to observe the quantitative prosody of the original\
language, and those in which the original measure is transmuted into\
frankly accentual verse.\
\
     The original impulse toward this classical or pseudo-classical\
     verse was a product of the Renaissance, when all forms of art not\
     based on Greek and Latin models were suspected. Rime, not being\
     found in the poetry of the classical languages, was treated as a\
     product of the dark ages,--the invention of "Goths and Huns." See\
     Roger Ascham's _Schoolmaster_ (1570) for the most characteristic\
     representative of this phase of thought in England. The new forms\
     of verse were, naturally enough, first tried in Italy. Schipper\
     traces the beginning of the movement to Alberti (1404-1484). A\
     century later Trissino wrote his _Sophonisbe_ and _Italia Liberata_\
     in unrimed verse, in professed imitation of Homer, and was looked\
     upon as the inventor of _versi sciolti_, that is, verses "freed"\
     from rime (compare the remarks of Milton in the prefatory note to\
     _Paradise Lost_). In 1539 Claudio Tolomei wrote _Versi e Regole\
     della Poesia Nuova_, a systematic attempt to introduce the\
     classical versification. He also wrote hexameters and sapphics. In\
     France there were similar efforts in the sixteenth century. Mousset\
     translated Homer into hexameters in 1530, and A. de Ba\'eff, a member\
     of the "Pleiade" (1532-1589), devised some French hexameters which\
     he called _vers ba\'effins_. The English experiments were worked out\
     independently, and yet under the same neo-classical influences. On\
     this subject, see Schipper, vol. ii. pp. 2-12, 439-464.\
\
\
A.--LYRICAL MEASURES\
\
    Reason, tell me thy mind, if here be reason\
    In this strange violence, to make resistance\
    Where sweet graces erect the stately banner\
    Of Virtue's regiment, shining in harness\
    Of Fortune's diadems, by Beauty mustered:\
    Say, then, Reason, I say, what is thy counsel?\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Phaleuciakes_, from the _Arcadia_, ab. 1580.)\
\
This is the measure commonly called "Phal\'e6cian." Compare Tennyson's\
imitation of it, in his Hendecasyllabics quoted below.\
\
    O sweet woods, the delight of solitariness!\
    O how much I do like your solitariness!\
    Where man's mind hath a freed consideration\
    Of goodness to receive lovely direction.\
    Where senses do behold the order of heavenly host,\
    And wise thoughts do behold what the Creator is.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Asclepiadics_, from the _Arcadia_. ab. 1580.)\
\
This is the measure now called "Lesser Asclepiadean."\
\
    My Muse, what ails this ardor\
    To blaze my only secrets?\
    Alas, it is no glory\
    To sing my own decay'd state.\
    Alas, it is no comfort\
    To speak without an answer;\
    Alas, it is no wisdom\
    To show the wound without cure.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Anacreontics_, from the _Arcadia_. ab. 1580.)\
\
Sidney was a member of the little group of classical students who called\
themselves the "Areopagus," and who were interested in introducing\
classical measures into English verse. Others of the group were Gabriel\
Harvey and Edmund Spenser, from whose correspondence most of our\
information regarding the movement is derived. (See the letters in\
Grosart's edition of Harvey's Works, vol. i. pp. 7-9, 20-24, 35-37,\
75-76, 99-107.) Spenser's only known efforts in the same direction are\
also preserved in this correspondence; a poem in twenty-one iambic\
trimeters, and this "tetrasticon":--\
\
    "See yee the blindfoulded pretie god, that feathered archer,\
      Of lovers miseries which maketh his bloodie game?\
    Wote ye why his moother with a veale hath coovered his face?\
      Trust me, least he my loove happely chaunce to beholde."\
\
It would seem that Spenser was attempting, more conscientiously than\
Sidney did, to follow the classical rules of quantity in making his\
verses; hence they are more difficult to read according to English\
rhythm. Sidney's experiments in the classical versification are perhaps\
the most successful, to modern taste, of all those made in the\
Elizabethan period. Among the other songs in the _Arcadia_ will be found\
sapphics and hexameters.\
\
     See especially Spenser's letter of April, 1580, and Harvey's reply\
     (_op. cit._, vol. i. pp. 35, 99), for notable passages indicating\
     the seriousness with which the members of the "Areopagus" were\
     trying to orm English verse so as to bring it under the rules of\
     classical prosody. The relations of quantity and accent were not\
     understood, as indeed they may be said still not to be understood\
     for the English language. Spenser suggests, in a frequently quoted\
     passage, that in the word _carpenter_ the middle syllable is "short\
     in speech, when it shall be read long in verse,"--that is, because\
     the vowel is followed by two consonants; hence it "seemeth like a\
     lame gosling that draweth one legge after her.... But it is to be\
     wonne with custome, and rough words must be subdued with use."\
     Harvey resented the idea that the common pronunciation of words\
     could be departed from in order to conform them to arbitrary\
     metrical rules, and in his reply said: "You shall never have my\
     subscription or consent ... to make your Carp\uc0\u275 nter our\
     Carp\uc0\u277 nter, an inche longer or bigger, than God and his Englishe\
     people have made him.... Else never heard I any that durst presume\
     so much over the Englishe ... as to alter the quantitie of any one\
     sillable, otherwise than oure common speache and generall receyved\
     custome woulde beare them oute." But while all English verse must\
     be consistent with "the vulgare and naturall mother prosodye,"\
     Harvey does not despair of finding a system that shall be at the\
     same time "countervaileable to the best tongues" in making possible\
     quantitative verse. The whole passage is well worth reading. The\
     best account of the movement toward classical versification in the\
     days of the "Areopagus" will be found in Professor Schelling's\
     _Poetic and Verse Criticism in the Reign of Elizabeth_\
     (Publications of the University of Pennsylvania).\
\
    O ye Nymphes most fine who resort to this brooke,\
    For to bathe there your pretty breasts at all times:\
    Leave the watrish bowres, hyther and to me come at my request nowe.\
\
    And ye Virgins trymme who resort to Parnass,\
    Whence the learned well Helicon beginneth:\
    Helpe to blase her worthy deserts, that all els mounteth above farre.\
\
(WILLIAM WEBBE: Sapphic Verse, in _A Discourse of English Poetrie_.\
1586.)\
\
Webbe was another of those who believed "that if the true kind of\
versifying in immitation of Greekes and Latines, had been practised in\
the English tongue, ... it would long ere this have aspyred to as full\
perfection, as in anie other tongue whatsoever." So he added to his\
_Discourse_ (see Arber Reprint, pp. 67-84) a discussion of the\
principles of quantitative prosody, and some specimens of what might be\
done by way of experiment.[42] The Sapphics from which the present\
specimen is taken are a paraphrase of Spenser's praise of Elizabeth in\
the fourth eclogue of the _Shepherd's Calendar_. (For a specimen of\
Webbe's hexameters, see p. 334, below.)\
\
    Greatest in thy wars,\
    Greater in thy peace,\
    Dread Elizabeth;\
    Our muse only truth,\
    Figments cannot use,\
    Thy ritch name to deck\
    That itselfe adorns:\
    But should now this age\
    Let all poesye fayne,\
    Fayning poesy could\
    Nothing faine at all\
    Worthy halfe thy fame.\
\
(THOMAS CAMPION: Iambic Dimeter, "an example Lyrical," in _Observations\
in the Art of English Poesie_. 1602.)\
\
      Rose-cheekt Lawra come\
    Sing thou smoothly with thy beawtie's\
    Silent musick, either other\
          Sweetely gracing.\
\
      Lovely formes do flowe\
    From concent devinely framed,\
    Heav'n is musick, and thy beawtie's\
          Birth is heavenly.\
\
(THOMAS CAMPION: Trochaic Dimeter, _ib._)\
\
The full title of Campion's work was: "Observations in the Art of\
English Poesie; wherein it is demonstratively proved, and by example\
confirmed, that the English toong will receive eight severall kinds of\
numbers, proper to it selfe, which are all in this booke set forth, and\
were never before this time by any man attempted." Campion, like other\
classical versifiers, condemned rime as a barbarity; but in imitating\
the classical measures he does not violate the normal English accent, so\
that his verses read smoothly in English rhythm. Curiously enough, he\
includes among his innovations an iambic measure which proves to be\
ordinary decasyllabic verse:\
\
    "Goe numbers boldly passe, stay not for ayde\
    Of shifting rime, that easie flatterer,\
    Whose witchcraft can the ruder eares beguile".\
\
Professor Schelling exclaims: "Where could the musical Doctor have kept\
his ears all this time? to propose this measure thus innocently for the\
drama, when the English stage had been ringing with his 'licentiate\
iambics' for more than two decades!"\
\
The second of the specimens quoted above Campion describes as a dimeter\
"whose first foote may either be a Sponde or Trochy: the two verses\
following are both of them Trochaical, and consist of foure feete, the\
first of either of them being a Spondee or Trochy, the other three only\
Trochyes. The fourth and last verse is made of two Trochyes. The number\
is voluble and fit to expresse any amorous conceit." (See also another\
of Campion's measures, in Part One, p. 27.)[43]\
\
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries few, if any, notable English\
poems were written in the classical measures. Goldsmith, in one of his\
essays (xviii, on Versification), maintained the possibility of reducing\
English words to the classical prosody, and said: "We have seen several\
late specimens of English hexameters and sapphics so happily composed\
that, by attaching them to the idea of ancient measure, we found them in\
all respects as melodious and agreeable to the ear as the works of\
Virgil and Anacreon, or Horace." But whose these were it seems to be\
impossible to say.\
\
    Needy knife-grinder! whither are you going?\
    Rough is the road, your wheel is out of order--\
    Bleak blows the blast;--your hat has got a hole in't,\
                              So have your breeches!\
\
    Weary knife-grinder! little think the proud ones\
    Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike-\
    road, what hard work 'tis crying all day, "Knives and\
                              Scissors to grind O!"\
\
(CANNING and FRERE: _Sapphics; the Friend of Humanity and the\
Knife-Grinder_, in the _Anti-Jacobin_, November, 1797).\
\
These "Sapphics" were a burlesque of some by Southey in similar stanzas,\
opening:\
\
    "Cold was the night wind, drifting fast the snow fell,\
    Wide were the downs and shelterless and naked,\
    When a poor wanderer struggled on her journey,\
                Weary and way-sore."\
\
"In this poem," said the _Anti-Jacobin_, not unjustly, "the pathos of\
the matter is not a little relieved by the absurdity of the metre."\
\
    O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,\
    O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity,\
      God-gifted organ-voice of England,\
        Milton, a name to resound for ages;\
    Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,\
    Starr'd from Jehovah's gorgeous armories,\
      Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean\
        Rings to the roar of an angel onset.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Milton; Alcaics._)\
\
    O you chorus of indolent reviewers,\
    Irresponsible, indolent reviewers,\
    Look, I come to the test, a tiny poem\
    All composed in a metre of Catullus,\
    All in quantity, careful of my motion,\
    Like the skater on ice that hardly bears him,\
    Lest I fall unawares before the people,\
    Waking laughter in indolent reviewers.\
    Should I flounder awhile without a tumble\
    Thro' this metrification of Catullus,\
    They should speak to me not without a welcome,\
    All that chorus of indolent reviewers.\
    Hard, hard, hard is it, only not to tumble,\
    So fantastical is the dainty metre.\
    Wherefore slight me not wholly, nor believe me\
    Too presumptuous, indolent reviewers.\
\
(TENNYSON: _Hendecasyllabics._)\
\
On the first of these stanzas of Tennyson, compare his stanzas to\
Maurice, and note, p. 77, above. With the hendecasyllabics, compare the\
"Phaleuciakes" of Sidney, p. 331, above, and "Hendecasyllabics" in\
Swinburne's _Poems and Ballads_.\
\
Tennyson took no little interest in the relations of classical and\
English metres, and seems to have believed in the possibility of genuine\
English quantitative verse. He did not, however, regard it as of\
practical value, and treated his own experiments as trifles. In his\
Memoirs, written by his son, Tennyson is said to have observed that he\
knew the quantity of every English word except _scissors_, a mysterious\
saying which may be set beside Southey's declaration that _Egypt_ is the\
only spondee in the English language. His son also preserves an\
extemporaneous line composed by Tennyson to illustrate the observance of\
quantity "regardless of accent":\
\
    "All men alike hate slops, particularly gruel;"\
\
and a sapphic stanza, also extemporized, quantitative but conforming to\
common accent:\
\
    "Faded ev'ry violet, all the roses;\
    Gone the glorious promise; and the victim,\
    Broken in this anger of Aphrodite,\
        Yields to the victor."\
\
(_Memoir_, vol. ii. p. 231.)\
\
    God, on verdurous Helicon\
    Dweller, child of Urania,\
      Thou that draw'st to the man the fair\
    Maiden, O Hymen\'e6us, O\
      Hymen, O Hymen\'e6us!\
\
(ROBINSON ELLIS: _Poems of Catullus_, LXI. 1871.)\
\
Mr. Ellis's translations from Catullus are all "in the metres of the\
original," and are among the most interesting specimens of modern\
classical versifying. "Tennyson's Alcaics and Hendecasyllabics," he said\
in his Preface, "suggested to me the new principle on which I was to go\
to work. It was not sufficient to reproduce the ancient metres, unless\
the ancient quantity was reproduced also." Of special interest is the\
imitation of the "almost unapproachable" galliambic verse of the _Attis_\
(pp. 49-53):\
\
    "When awoke the sun, the golden, that his eyes heaven-orient\
    Scann'd lustrous air, the rude seas, earth's massy solidity,\
    When he smote the shadowy twilight with his healthy team sublime,\
    Then arous'd was Attis; o'er him sleep hastily fled away\
    To Pasithea's arms immortal with a tremulous hovering."\
\
As Mr. Ellis observes, the metre of Tennyson's _Boadicea_ was modelled\
on this of Catullus. Compare also Mr. George Meredith's _Pha\'ebthon_,\
"attempted in the galliambic measure":\
\
    "At the coming up of Ph\'9cbus, the all-luminous charioteer,\
    Double-visaged stand the mountains in imperial multitudes,\
    And with shadows dappled, men sing to him, Hail, O Beneficent;\
    For they shudder chill, the earth-vales, at his clouding, shudder\
        to black."\
\
    --Saw the white implacable Aphrodite,\
    Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled\
    Shine as fire of sunset on western waters;\
        Saw the reluctant\
\
    Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her,\
    Looking always, looking with necks reverted,\
    Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder\
        Shone Mitylene.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Sapphics_, in _Poems and Ballads_.)\
\
    Love, what ailed thee to leave life that was made lovely, we thought,\
        with love?\
    What sweet visions of sleep lured thee away, down from the light above?\
\
    What strange faces of dreams, voices that called, hands that were raised\
        to wave,\
    Lured or led thee, alas, out of the sun, down to the sunless grave?\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Choriambics_, in _Poems and Ballads_, Second Series, 1878.)\
\
Swinburne's imitations of classical measures are frankly accentual, with\
no effort to introduce fixed quantities into English.\
\
\
B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER\
\
    Lady, reserved by the heavens to do pastors' company honor,\
    Joining your sweet voice to the rural Muse of a desert,\
    Here you fully do find this strange operation of love,\
    How to the woods Love runs, as well as rides to the palace,\
    Neither he bears reverence to a prince nor pity to beggar,\
    But (like a point in midst of a circle) is still of a nearness,\
    All to a lesson he draws, neither hills nor caves can avoid him.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _Dorus and Zelmane_, in the _Arcadia_. ab. 1580.)\
\
Sidney was evidently trying to write genuinely quantitative hexameters.\
Thus "of love," in the third line, may be regarded as a quantitative\
spondee (the _o_ being followed by two consonants), although the _of_\
would not naturally be stressed. In like manner it is very possible that\
"pallace" was spelled with two _l_'s in order to make the first syllable\
seem long.\
\
Sidney's hexameters are the first in literary verse which have come down\
to us; but there must have been earlier efforts at least by the time of\
Ascham's _Schoolmaster_ (1570), which vigorously attacked "our rude\
beggerly ryming, brought first into Italie by Gothes and Hunnes, ... and\
at last receyved into England by men of excellent wit in deede, but of\
small learning, and less judgement in that behalfe." (Arber Reprint, p.\
145.) One hexameter distich by a contemporary and friend of Ascham's,\
Master Watson of Cambridge, is handed down to us by Webbe, as being\
"common in the mouthes of all men":\
\
    "All travellers doo gladlie report great praise to Ulisses\
    For that he knewe manie mens maners, and saw many citties."\
\
(_Discourse of English Poetrie_, p. 72.)\
\
    But the Queene in meane while with carks quandare deepe anguisht,\
    Her wound fed by Venus, with firebayt smoldred is hooked.\

    His woords fitlye placed, with his hevnly phisnomye pleasing,\
    March throgh her hert mustring, al in her brest deepelye she printeth.\
    Theese carcking cratchets her sleeping natural hynder.\

    When to her deere sister with woords haulf gyddye she raveth.\

    How brave he dooth court yt? what strength and coorrage he carryes?\
    I beleve yt certeyn (ne yet hold I yt vaynelye reported)\
    That fro the great linnadge of gods his pettegre shooteth."\
\
(RICHARD STANYHURST: Vergil's _\'c6neid_, bk. iv. 1582.)\
\
Stanyhurst's _Vergil_ is one of the curiosities of Elizabethan\
literature, not only from its verse-form but from its spelling and\
diction. The translator declares himself a disciple of Ascham, in his\
antipathy to rimed verse; "What Tom Towly is so simple," he asks, "that\
wyl not attempt too bee a _rithmoure_?" In an address to the Learned\
Reader he explains his system of English quantitative prosody. In 1593\
Stanyhurst's hexameters were severely noticed in a passage by Thomas\
Nash directed primarily against the classical versifying of Gabriel\
Harvey. "The hexamiter verse," said Nash, "I graunt to be a gentleman of\
an auncient house (so is many an English begger), yet this clyme of ours\
he cannot thrive in; our speech is too craggy for him to set his plough\
in; hee goes twitching and hopping in our language, like a man running\
upon quagmiers, up the hill in one syllable and down the dale in\
another, retaining no part of that stately smooth gate which he vaunts\
himselfe with among the Greeks and Latins.... Master Stannyhurst (though\
otherwise learned) trod a foule lumbring boystrous wallowing measure, in\
his translation of Virgil." (Works of Nash, Grosart edition, vol. ii.\
pp. 237, 238.)\
\
Stanyhurst was also ridiculed by Joseph Hall, in the Satires of his\
_Virgidemiarum_ (1597):\
\
    "Another scorns the home-spun thread of rhymes,\
    Match'd with the lofty feet of elder times:\
    Give me the numbred verse that Virgil sung,\
    And Virgil's self shall speak the English tongue:\
    Manhood and garboiles shall he chaunt with chaunged feet\
    And head-strong dactyls making music meet.\
    The nimble dactyl striving to out-go,\
    The drawling spondees pacing it below.\
    The lingring spondees, labouring to delay,\
    The breathless dactyls with a sudden stay.\
    Whoever saw a colt wanton and wild\
    Yok'd with a slow-foot ox on fallow field,\
    Can right areed how handsomely besets\
    Dull spondees with the English dactylets."\
\
(CHALMERS'S _English Poets_, vol. v. p. 266.)\
\
Compare the lines of Chapman, in his _Hymn to Cynthia_, where he says\
that\
\
                                "sweet poesy\
    Will not be clad in her supremacy\
    With those strange garments (Rome's hexameters)\
    As she is English; but in right prefers\
    Our native robes."\
\
See also, in Arber's edition of Stanyhurst in the _English Scholar's\
Library_, an account of another work in hexameters, published\
anonymously in 1599: the _First Booke of the Preservation of King Henry\
the VII_. This writer admired Stanyhurst's effort, but desired "him to\
refile" his verses into more polished English:\
\
    "If the Poet Stanihurst yet live and feedeth on ay-er,\
    I do request him (as one that wisheth a grace to the meter)\
    With wordes significant to refile and finely to polishe\
    Those fower _\'c6neis_, that he late translated in English."\
\
In the same connection the writer tells us definitely what is to be\
hoped from the "trew kind of Hexametred and Pentametred verse." "First\
it will enrich our speach with good and significant wordes: Secondly it\
will bring a delight and pleasure to the skilfull Reader, when he seeth\
them formally compyled: And thirdly it will incourage and learne the\
good and godly Students, that affect Poetry, and are naturally enclyned\
thereunto, to make the like: Fourthly it will direct a trew Idioma, and\
will teach trew Orthography."[44]\
\
    Tityrus, happilie thou lyste tumbling under a beech tree,\
    All in a fine oate pipe these sweete songs lustilie chaunting:\

    And fro our pastures sweete: thou Tityr, at ease in a shade plott\
    Makst thicke groves to resound with songes of brave Amarillis.\
\
(WILLIAM WEBBE: Vergil's First Eclogue, in _A Discourse of English\
Poetrie_. 1586.)\
\
Webbe prefaces his hexameters with a reference to those made by Gabriel\
Harvey, and says: "I for my part, so farre as those examples would leade\
me, and mine owne small skyll affoorde me, have blundered upon these\
fewe; whereinto I have translated the two first \'c6glogues of Virgill:\
because I thought no matter of my owne invention, nor any other of\
antiquitye more fitte for tryal of thys thyng, before there were some\
more speciall direction, which might leade to a lesse troublesome manner\
of wryting." (Arber Reprint, p. 72.)\
\
    Thou, who roll'st in the firmament, round as the shield of my fathers,\
    Whence is thy girdle of glory, O Sun! and thy light everlasting?\
    Forth thou comest in thy awful beauty; the stars at thy rising\
    Haste to their azure pavilions; the moon sinks pale in the waters;\
    But thou movest alone; who dareth to wander beside thee?\
    Oaks of the mountains decay, and the hard oak crumbles asunder;\
    Ocean shrinks and again grows; lost is the moon from the heavens;\
    Whilst thou ever remainest the same to rejoice in thy brightness.\
\
(WILLIAM TAYLOR: Paraphrase of _Ossian's Hymn to the Sun_. 1796.)\
\
When English hexameters were revived at the end of the eighteenth\
century, it was in good part under German influence. Bodmer, Klopstock,\
and Voss, followed later by Goethe, made the German hexameter popular;\
and William Taylor of Norwich, who in many ways helped to familiarize\
his countrymen with German literature, became interested in the form. In\
1796, the year of Goethe's _Hermann und Dorothea_, he contributed to the\
_Monthly Magazine_ an article called "English Hexameters Exemplified,"\
in which occurred the paraphrase from Ossian here quoted. Taylor pointed\
out that the hexameter of the Germans was purely accentual. They were\
"obliged, by the scarceness of long vowels and the rifeness of short\
syllables in their language, to tolerate the frequent substitution of\
trochees for spondees in their hexameter verse; and they scan, like\
other modern nations, by emphasis, not by position." (Quoted in J. W.\
Robberds's _Memoir of William Taylor of Norwich_, vol. i. pp. 157 ff.)\
Most later writers of English hexameters have followed the line here\
indicated, and have frankly abandoned the effort to represent the\
quantities of classical prosody.\
\
    Earth! thou mother of numberless children, the nurse and the mother,\
    Sister thou of the stars, and beloved by the Sun, the rejoicer!\
    Guardian and friend of the moon, O Earth, whom the comets forget not,\
    Yea, in the measureless distance wheel round and again they behold thee!\
    Fadeless and young (and what if the latest birth of creation?)\
    Bride and consort of Heaven, that looks down upon thee enamoured!\
\
(COLERIDGE: _Hymn to the Earth._ 1799.)\
\
Coleridge made several experiments in hexameters at this time, and\
planned, together with Southey, a long hexameter poem on Mohammed. To\
Wordsworth he sent an experiment of the same kind in a lighter vein:\
\
    "Smooth out the folds of my letter, and place it on desk or on table;\
    Place it on table or desk; and your right hands loosely half-closing,\
    Gently sustain them in air, and extending the digit didactic,\
    Rest it a moment on each of the forks of the five-forked left hand,\
    Twice on the breadth of the thumb, and once on the tip of each finger,\
    Read with a nod of the head in a humoring recitativo;\
    And, as I live, you will see my hexameters hopping before you.\
    This is a galloping measure, a hop, and a trot, and a gallop!"\
\
(Wordsworth's _Memoirs_, quoted in Coleridge's Poems, Aldine edition,\
vol. ii. p. 307.)\
\
Coleridge also translated from Schiller the well-known distich\
describing and exemplifying the elegiac verse of Ovid:\
\
    "In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column;\
    In the pentameter aye falling in melody back."\
\
This distich, it is interesting to find, was revised by Tennyson so as\
to represent the measure quantitatively rather than accentually:\
\
    "Up springs hexameter, with might, as a fountain arising,\
    Lightly the fountain falls, lightly the pentameter."\
\
    Lift up your heads, ye gates; and ye everlasting portals,\
    Be ye lift up! Behold, the Worthies are there to receive him,--\
    They who, in later days or in elder ages, ennobled\
    Britain's dear name. Bede I beheld, who, humble and holy,\
    Shone like a single star, serene in a night of darkness.\
    Bacon also was there, the marvellous Friar; and he who\
    Struck the spark from which the Bohemian kindled his taper;\
    Thence the flame, long and hardly preserved, was to Luther transmitted,--\
    Mighty soul; and he lifted his torch, and enlightened the nations.\
\
(SOUTHEY: _A Vision of Judgment_, ix. 1821.)\
\
Southey followed the example of William Taylor in attempting to\
construct hexameters "which would be perfectly consistent with the\
character of our language, and capable of great richness, variety and\
strength," yet which should not profess to follow "rules which are\
inapplicable to our tongue." (Preface to _Vision of Judgment_, Southey's\
Works, ed. 1838, vol. x. p. 195.)[45] In the same Preface he briefly\
reviewed the history of earlier efforts to introduce the classical\
measures into English. It is to be feared that Southey's hexameters are\
to be counted among the worst of modern times.\
\
    Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,\
    Sat the lovers and whispered together, beholding the moon rise\
    Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.\
    Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,\
    Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.\
      Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry\
    Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway\
    Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.\
\
(LONGFELLOW: _Evangeline_, Part. I. 1847.)\
\
_Evangeline_ is undoubtedly the most popular and widely read poem in\
English hexameters, and may be said to have revived the vogue of the\
measure in the middle of the nineteenth century. Yet its metrical\
qualities have not pleased most careful critics. Matthew Arnold said\
that the reception which the poem met with indicated that the dislike\
for the metre "is rather among professional critics than among the\
general public. Yet," he went on to say, "a version of Homer in\
hexameters of the _Evangeline_ type would not satisfy the judicious, nor\
is the definite establishment of this type to be desired." (_On\
Translating Homer_, Macmillan ed., p. 284.) Mr. Arnold had previously\
suggested that the "lumbering effect" of such hexameters as Longfellow's\
is "caused by their being much too dactylic"; more spondees should be\
introduced.\
\
The editor of the Riverside edition of _Evangeline_ remarks\
interestingly: "The measure lends itself easily to the lingering\
melancholy which marks the greater part of the poem. The fall of the\
verse at the end of the line and the sharp recovery at the beginning of\
the next will be snares to the reader, who must beware of a jerking\
style of delivery.... A little practice will enable one to acquire that\
habit of reading the hexameter which we may liken, roughly, to the\
climbing of a hill, resting a moment on the summit, and then descending\
the other side."\
\
Longfellow's hexameters were criticised most severely by his countryman,\
Edgar Poe. Poe denied the possibility of any adequate representation of\
the classical hexameter in English, largely because of the impossibility\
of using English spondees. The only genuine hexameters he knew, he\
declared, were some he had himself made, running:\
\
    "Do tell! when may we hope to make men of sense out of the Pundits,\
    Born and brought up with their snouts deep down in the mud of the\
        Frog-pond?"\
\
(See Poe's Works, ed. Stedman and Woodberry, vol. vi. p. 104.)\
\
Another interesting American experiment in hexameters is found in the\
_Home Pastorals_ of Bayard Taylor (1869-1874). Taylor modeled his verses\
after those of the Germans, particularly Goethe's in _Hermann und\
Dorothea_. See, for example, the opening lines of _November_:\
\
    "Wrapped in his sad-colored cloak, the Day, like a Puritan, standeth\
    Stern in the joyless fields, rebuking the lingering color,--\
    Dying hectic of leaves and the chilly blue of the asters,--\
    Hearing, perchance, the croak of a crow on the desolate tree-top,\
    Breathing the reek of withered reeds, or the drifted and sodden\
    Splendors of woodland, as whoso piously groaneth in spirit:\
    'Vanity, verily; yea, it is vanity, let me forsake it!'"\
    But as the light of day enters some populous city,\
    Shaming away, ere it come, by the chilly day-streak signal,\
    High and low, the misusers of night, shaming out the gas-lamps--\
    All the great empty streets are flooded with broadening clearness\
    Which, withal, by inscrutable simultaneous access\
    Permeates far and pierces to the very cellars lying in\
    Narrow high back-lane, and court, and alley of alleys:--\
    He that goes forth to his walks, while speeding to the suburb,\
    Sees sights only peaceful and pure; as laborers settling\
    Slowly to work, in their limbs the lingering sweetness of slumber;\
    Humble market-carts, coming in, bringing in, not only\
    Flower, fruit, farm-store, but sounds and sights of the country\
    Dwelling yet on the sense of the dreamy drivers; soon after\
    Half-awake servant-maids unfastening drowsy shutters\
    Up at the windows, or down, letting in the air by the doorway,\
    School-boys, school-girls soon, with slate, portfolio, satchel,\
    Hampered as they haste, those running, these others maidenly tripping;...\
    Meantime above purer air untarnished of new-lit fires;\
    So that the whole great wicked artificial civilised fabric--\
    All its unfinished houses, lots for sale, and railway out-works--\
    Seems reaccepted, resumed to Primal Nature and Beauty.\
\
(ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH: _The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich_. 1848.)\
\
Clough's hexameters are quite unlike any others in English poetry, both\
in their metrical quality and in their use for serio-comic verse. As\
Matthew Arnold observed, they are "excessively, needlessly rough," but\
their free, garrulous effect has a charm of its own. Clough also wrote\
some hexameters intended to be strictly quantitative. (For a detailed\
criticism of the verse of the _Bothie_, see Robert Bridges's _Milton's\
Prosody_, 1901 ed., Appendix J.)\
\
It was Clough's hexameters, together with some "English Hexameter\
Translations" by Dr. Hawtrey and Mr. Lockhart (1847), that chiefly\
encouraged Matthew Arnold to believe that the measure might be well\
adapted to a translation of Homer. "The hexameter, whether alone or with\
the pentameter, possesses a movement, an expression, which no metre\
hitherto in common use amongst us possesses, and which I am convinced\
English poetry, as our mental wants multiply, will not always be content\
to forego." (_Ib._, p. 210.) Mr. James Spedding replied to Mr. Arnold's\
suggestion, from the point of view of the classical scholar, urging that\
only hexameters purely quantitative could properly represent those of\
Vergil. He illustrated his views by an amusing "hexametrical dialogue,"\
conducted alternately in Vergilian measure and "in that of Longfellow."\
Of the former are the lines:\
\
    "Verses so modulate, so tuned, so varied in accent,\
    Rich with unexpected changes, smooth, stately, sonorous,\
    Rolling ever forward, tidelike, with thunder, in endless\
    Procession, complex melodies--pause, quantity, accent,\
    After Virgilian precedent and practice, in order\
    Distributed--could these gratify th' Etonian ear-drum?"\
\
(JAMES SPEDDING: _Reviews and Discussions_, 1879. p. 327.)\
\
Arnold, however, wisely declined to be led into a discussion of the\
relations of accent and quantity in English. "All we are here concerned\
with," he said, "is the imitation, by the English hexameter, of the\
ancient hexameter _in its effect upon us moderns_.... The received\
English type, in its general outlines, is, for England, the necessary\
given type of this metre; it is by rendering the metrical beat of its\
pattern, not by rendering the accentual beat of it, that the English\
language has adapted the Greek hexameter.... I look with hope towards\
continued attempts at perfecting and employing this rhythm; but my\
belief in the immediate success of such attempts is far less confident\
than has been supposed." (See the whole passage, _On Translating Homer_,\
pp. 275-284.)\
\
The hexameters of Dr. Hawtrey, quoted by Arnold, are these:\
\
    Clearly the rest I behold of the dark-eyed sons of Achaia;\
    Known to me well are the faces of all; their names I remember;\
    Two, two only remain, whom I see not among the commanders,\
    Kastor fleet in the car,--Polydeukes brave with the cestus,--\
    Own dear brethren of mine,--one parent loved us as infants.\
    Are they not here in the host, from the shores of loved Lakedaimon,\
    Or, though they came with the rest in ships that bound through the waters,\
    Dare they not enter the fight or stand in the council of heroes,\
    All for fear of the shame and the taunts my crime has awakened?\
    --So said she. They long since in Earth's soft arms were reposing,\
    There, in their own dear land, their fatherland, Lakedaimon.\
\
(From _English Hexameter Translations_, p. 242.)\
\
Arnold also illustrated his doctrine in some hexameters of his own,\
which have not usually been regarded as a happy experiment. They run in\
part as follows:\
\
    "Truly, yet this time will we save thee, mighty Achilles!\
    But thy day of death is at hand; nor shall we be the reason--\
    No, but the will of heaven, and Fate's invincible power.\
    For by no slow pace nor want of swiftness of ours\
    Did the Trojans obtain to strip the arms from Patroclus;\
    But that prince among gods, the son of the lovely-haired Leto,\
    Slew him fighting in front of the fray, and glorified Hector.\
    But, for us, we vie in speed with the breath of the West-Wind,\
    Which, men say, is the fleetest of winds; 'tis thou who art fated\
    To lie low in death, by the hand of a god and a mortal."\
\
(_Ib._, p. 234.)\
\
Tennyson evidently viewed with small respect these various efforts to\
render Homer in English hexameters. See his lines beginning:\
\
    "These lame hexameters the strong-wing'd music of Homer!\
    No--but a most burlesque barbarous experiment."\
\
(_In Quantity: Hexameters and Pentameters_.)\
\
Compare the amusing lines of Walter Savage Landor:\
\
    "Askest thou if in my youth I have mounted, as others have mounted,\
    Galloping Hexameter, Pentameter cantering after,\
    English by dam and by sire; bit, bridle, and saddlery, English;\
    English the girths and the shoes; all English from snaffle to crupper;\
    Everything English about, excepting the tune of the jockey?....\
    Seldom my goosequill, of goose from Germany, fatted in England,\
    (Frolicsome though I have been) have I tried on Hexameter, knowing\
    Latin and Greek are alone its languages. We have a measure\
    Fashioned by Milton's own hand, a fuller, a deeper, a louder.\
    .... Peace be with all! but afar be ambition to follow the Roman,\
    Led by the German uncombed and jigging in dactyl and spondee,\
    Lumbering shapeless jackboots which nothing can polish or supple.\
    Much as old metres delight me, 'tis only where first they were nurtured,\
    In their own clime, their own speech: than pamper them here, I would rather\
    Tie up my Pegasus tight to the scanty-fed rack of a sonnet."\
\
(_English Hexameters_, in _The Last Fruit off an Old Tree_.)\
\
In like manner Mr. Swinburne says: "I must say how inexplicable it seems\
to me that Mr. Arnold, of all men, should be a patron of English\
hexameters. His own I have tried in vain to reduce by scansion into any\
metrical feet at all; they look like nothing on earth, and sound like\
anapests broken up and driven wrong.... And at best what ugly bastards\
of verse are these self-styled hexameters! how human tongues or hands\
could utter or could write them except by way of burlesque improvisation\
I could never imagine, and never shall." (_Essays and Studies_, p. 163.)\
From this condemnation Mr. Swinburne excepts only the hexameters of Dr.\
Hawtrey, "but that is simply a graceful interlude of pastime."\
\
See also the essay called "Remarks on English Hexameters," in the _Hor\'e6\
Hellenic\'e6_ of Professor John Stuart Blackie.\
\
    Hovering over the water he came, upon glittering pinions,\
    Living, a wonder, outgrown from the tight-laced fold of his sandals;\
    Bounding from billow to billow, and sweeping the crests like a sea-gull;\
    Leaping the gulfs of the surge, as he laughed in the joy of his leaping.\
    Fair and majestic he sprang to the rock; and the maiden in wonder\
    Gazed for a while, and then hid in the dark-rolling wave of her tresses,\
    Fearful, the light of her eyes; while the boy (for her sorrow had awed\
        him)\
    Blushed at her blushes, and vanished, like mist on the cliffs at the\
        sunrise.\
    Fearful at length she looked forth: he was gone: she, wild with amazement,\
    Wailed for her mother aloud: but the wail of the wind only answered.\
\
(CHARLES KINGSLEY: _Andromeda_. 1858.)\
\
Kingsley believed in the possibility of representing the quantitative\
verse of classical poetry in English, and at the same time holding to\
genuinely English rhythm.[46] Thus he tried to introduce more real\
spondees into his hexameters than Longfellow and others had done.\
Compare such a line as Longfellow's--\
\
    "Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice"--\
\
with Kingsley's--\
\
    "Then as a pine upon Ida when south-west winds blow landward."\
\
In the former the dissyllabic feet are in no sense spondees; in the\
latter there is an effort to fill them with genuinely long syllables.\
\
    Lover whose vehement kisses on lips irresponsive are squandered,\
    Lover that wooest in vain Earth's imperturbable heart;\
    Athlete mightily frustrate, who pittest thy thews against legions,\
    Locked with fantastical hosts, bodiless arms of the sky;\
    Sea that breakest for ever, that breakest and never art broken,\
    Like unto thine, from of old, springeth the spirit of man,--\
    Nature's wooer and fighter, whose years are a suit and a wrestling,\
    All their hours, from his birth, hot with desire and with fray.\
\
(WILLIAM WATSON: _Hymn to the Sea_, ii.)\
\
Here the alternate lines represent the "pentameter" of the Latin elegiac\
verse, where the light syllables were omitted at the cesura and the end\
of the line.\
\
    When they came to the fair-flowing river and to the places\
    Where stood pools in plenty prepared, and water abundant\
    Gushed up, a cure for things manifold uncleanly, the mules were\
    Unyoked from the waggons, driven off to the bindweed pastures\
    By the rushing swirling river, and the women set about it\
    Unloading the waggons, carrying clothes down to the water,\
    One with other striving, stepping hastily into the wash-troughs.\
    When washing and rinsing were done, they brought the linen down\
    On to the sea-shore, and set it all out thereupon in rows\
    Where the pebbles thrown up by the waves most thickly abounded.\
\
(WILLIAM JOHNSON STONE: Translation of _Odyssey_, vi. 85 ff., in _The\
Use of Classical Measures in English_. 1899.)\
\
Mr. Stone, like the Elizabethan classical versifiers, seeks to write\
purely quantitative verse in English, and, so far from aiming at the\
same time to preserve the rhythm of the usual English hexameter, he\
regards the clash between accent and quantity as a beauty rather than a\
defect. The verses he intends to be read "with the natural accent\
unimpaired," the reader listening for the regular quantities at the same\
time.\
\
     The views of Mr. Stone on the nature of English accent and quantity\
     are perhaps unique among modern writers on the subject. "The\
     ordinary unemphatic English accent is exactly a raising of pitch,\
     and nothing more," as in Greek. "The accent of emphasis is\
     something quite different in character from the ordinary accent."\
     To those who insist that to them the second syllable of\
     _carpenter_ is distinctly short, Mr. Stone replies: "You are\
     associating yourselves by such an admission with the vulgar actors\
     of Plautus rather than the educated readers of Virgil;"--a truly\
     terrible charge! Mr. Stone gives an interesting critical history of\
     earlier efforts to introduce classical measures into English. His\
     monograph is reprinted, but without the specimen translation, as\
     the second part of the 1901 edition of Robert Bridges's _Milton's\
     Prosody_.\

FOOTNOTES:\
\
[42] Puttenham's treatise on English poetry, which followed Webbe's\
(1589), and was the most thorough treatment of the subject written in\
the Elizabethan period, also discussed the "reformed versifying," but\
with less respect. The chapter is entitled: "How if all maner of sodaine\
innovations were not very scandalous, specially in the lawes of any\
langage or arte, the use of the Greeke and Latine feete might be brought\
into our vulgar Poesie, and with good grace inough." (Arber Reprint of\
_The Arte of English Poesie_, p. 126.) Puttenham seems to see the\
relations of quantity and accent somewhat more clearly than most of his\
contemporaries, and while he gives rules for adapting English words to\
quantitative prosody, he is disposed to think that "peradventure with us\
Englishmen it be somewhat too late to admit a new invention of feete and\
times that our forefathers never used nor never observed till this day"\
(p. 132).\
\
[43] Campion's _Observations_ are reprinted in Mr. Bullen's edition of\
his poems, and also in Rhys's _Literary Pamphlets_, vol. i. His attack\
on the customary English rimed verse was answered by the poet laureate,\
Samuel Daniel, who published in the same year (1602) his _Defence of\
Ryme against a Pamphlet entituled Observations in the Art of English\
Poesie_. "Wherein is demonstratively prooved that Ryme is the fittest\
harmonie of words that comports with our Language." Daniel struck at the\
root of all the principles of the classical versifiers,--the supreme\
authority of the classics. "We are the children of nature as well as\
they," he exclaims with reference to the ancients. "It is not the\
observing of Trochaiques nor their Iambiques, that will make our\
writings ought the wiser." And he expounds the English accentual\
verse-system with clearness and vigor. This essay of Daniel's may be\
said to mark the end, if it did not bring about the end, of the\
Elizabethan experiments in classical metres. For other contemporary\
criticism of the effort, see under the following section, on the\
Hexameter.\

\
[45] Southey's effort was attacked by the Rev. S. Tillbrook, Fellow of\
Peterhouse, in a pamphlet entitled "Historical and Critical Remarks upon\
the Modern Hexameters, and upon Mr. Southey's _Vision of Judgment_." To\
this Southey replied in the second edition of his poem, saying to Mr.\
Tillbrook: "You try the measure by Greek and Latin prosody: you might as\
well try me by the Laws of Solon, or the Twelve Tables. I have\
distinctly stated that the English hexameter is not constructed upon\
those canons." He further appealed to the success of the hexameter in\
Germany, and concluded: "I am glad that I have made the experiment, and\
quite satisfied with the result. The critics who write and talk are with\
you: so I dare say are the whole posse of schoolmasters. The women, the\
young poets, and the _docile bairns_ are with me." (_Op. cit._, Preface\
to the Present Edition, pp. xix, xxi.)\
\
[46] For Kingsley's exposition of his theories, see the _Letters and\
Memories_, edited by his wife, vol. i. pp. 338-344. He declined to yield\
to "trocheism one atom. My ear always demands the equivalent of the\
'lost short syllable.'" And again: "Every argument you bring convinces\
me more and more that the theory of our prosody depending on accent is\
false, and that it really is very nearly identical with the Greek.... I\
am glad to hear (being a lazy man) that I have more license than I wish\
for; but I do think that, with proper care, you may have as many\
spondees, without hurting the rhythm, in English as you have in Greek,\
and my ear is tortured by a trochee instead.... I must try for Homer's\
average of a spondee a line."\

\
VII. IMITATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL FRENCH LYRICAL FORMS\
\
\
A number of artificial lyrical forms, originating in the ingenuity of\
the medi\'e6val Proven\'e7al poets, were adopted by the Middle English\
imitators of the Romance lyrists, and were revived with no little vigor\
in the Victorian period. Chief among the influential models for these\
forms, in early times, were the poems of Machault (1284-1377), Deschamps\
(1328-1415), Froissart (1337-1410), and Villon (1431-1485). Again in the\
seventeenth century such forms as the rondeau were revived in France by\
Voiture (1598-1648), but with little effect in England. Finally, in the\
nineteenth century, the forms were reintroduced by M. Th\'e9odore de\
Banville, and later into England by Mr. Lang, Mr. Austin Dobson, Mr.\
Gosse, and others. For the history of these fashions in outline, see the\
admirable introduction to Mr. Gleeson White's _Ballades and Rondeaus_\
(1893); also Mr. Andrew Lang's _Lays and Lyrics of Old France_ (1872);\
Mr. Austin Dobson's "Note on some Foreign Forms of Verse," in the\
collection of _Latter Day Lyrics_ (1878); and an article by Mr. Edmund\
Gosse in the _Cornhill Magazine_, July, 1877.\
\
Says Mr. Dobson: "It may be conceded that the majority of the forms now\
in question are not at present suited for ... the treatment of grave or\
elevated themes. What is modestly advanced for some of them ... is that\
they may add a new charm of buoyancy,--a lyric freshness,--to amatory\
and familiar verse, already too much condemned to faded measures and\
out-worn cadences. Further, ... that they are admirable vehicles for the\
expression of trifles or _jeux d'esprit_. They have also a humbler and\
obscurer use. If, to quote the once-hackneyed, but now\
too-much-forgotten maxim of Pope--\
\
    'Those move easiest that have learned to dance,'\
\
what better discipline, among others, could possibly be devised for\
'those about to versify' than a course of Rondeaux, Triolets, and\
Ballades?" Mr. Dobson refers to the article by Mr. Gosse already cited,\
and "to the _Odes Funambulesques_, the _Petit Trait\'e9 de Po\'e9sie\
Fran\'e7aise_, and other works of M. Th\'e9odore de Banville. To M. de\
Banville in particular and to the second French Romantic School in\
general, the happy modernization in France of the old measures of Marot,\
Villon, and Charles of Orleans is mainly to be ascribed." (_Latter Day\
Lyrics_, ed. W. D. Adams, pp. 334 ff.)[47]\
\
Says Mr. Gleeson White: "The taste for these _tours de force_ in the art\
of verse-making is no doubt an acquired one; yet to quote the first\
attempt to produce a lyric with a repeated burden would take one back to\
the earliest civilization.... Whether the first refrains were used for\
decorative effect only, or to give the singer time to recollect or\
improvise the next verse, it matters little, since the once mere adjunct\
was made in later French use an integral and vital part of the verse.\
The charm of these strictly written verses is undoubtedly increased by\
some knowledge of their technical rules.... To approach ideal\
perfection, nothing less than implicit obedience to all the rules is the\
first element of success; but the task is by no means finished there.\
Every quality that poetry demands, whether clearness of thought,\
elegance of expression, harmonious sound, or faultless rhythm, is needed\
as much in these shapes as in unfettered verse.... It may be said,\
without fear of exaggeration, that all the qualities required to form a\
perfect lyric in poetry are equally needful here, _plus_ a great many\
special ones the forms themselves demand. To the students of any art\
there is always a peculiar charm when the highest difficulties are\
surmounted with such ease that the consummate art is hidden to all who\
know not the magic password to unveil it." (_Ballades and Rondeaus_,\
Introduction, pp. xli, xlii.) "No one is compelled to use these complex\
forms, but if chosen, their laws must be obeyed to the letter if success\
is to be obtained. The chief pleasure they yield consists in the\
apparent spontaneity, which is the result of genius, if genius be indeed\
the art of taking infinite pains; or, if that definition is rejected,\
they must yet exhibit the art which conceals art, whether by intense\
care in every minute detail, or a happy faculty for naturally wearing\
these fetters." (_Ib._, pp. l, li.)\
\
\
A.--THE BALLADE\
\
The ballade commonly consists of three stanzas, with an envoy. In modern\
usage the stanzas usually contain either eight or ten lines, and the\
envoy half as many as the stanza; but in earlier usage both stanza and\
envoy varied, and the latter might be omitted altogether. The rimes in\
all the stanzas must be identical in the corresponding lines, but the\
riming words must be different. The most characteristic element is the\
refrain,--the keynote of the poem,--which forms the last line of each\
stanza, including the envoy. The favorite rime-scheme for the eight-line\
stanza is _ababbcbc_, with the envoy _bcbc_. Mr. White says of the envoy\
that it "is not only a dedication, but should be the peroration of the\
subject, and richer in its wording and more stately in its imagery than\
the preceding verses, to convey the climax of the whole matter, and\
avoid the suspicion that it is a mere postscript."\
\
    Flee fro the prees, and dwelle with sothfastnesse,\
    Suffyce unto thy good, though hit be smal;\
    For hord hath hate, and climbing tikelnesse,\
    Prees hath envye, and wele blent overal;\
    Savour no more than thee bihove shal;\
    Werk wel thy-self, that other folk canst rede;\
    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\
\
    Tempest thee noght al croked to redresse,\
    In trust of hir that turneth as a bal:\
    Gret reste slant in litel besinesse;\
    And eek be war to sporne ageyn an al;\
    Stryve noght, as doth the crokke with the wal.\
    Daunte thy-self, that dauntest otheres dede;\
    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\
\
    That thee is sent, receyve in buxumnesse;\
    The wrastling for this worlde axeth a fal.\
    Her nis non hoom, her nis but wildernesse:\
    Forth, pilgrim, forth! Forth, beste, out of thy stal!\
    Know thy contree, look up, thank God of al;\
    Hold the hye wey, and lat thy gost thee lede:\
    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\
\
    _Envoy_\
\
    Therfore, thou vache, leve thyn old wrecchednesse\
    Unto the worlde; leve now to be thral;\
    Crye him mercy, that of his hy goodnesse\
    Made thee of noght, and in especial\
    Draw unto him, and pray in general\
    For thee, and eek for other, hevenlich mede;\
    And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede.\
\
(CHAUCER: _Balade de bon conseyl._ ab. 1385.)\
\
Here Chaucer follows the rules of the ballade carefully, but in the\
"rime royal" stanza. It will be noticed that the rime-word "al" seems to\
be repeated, but it is used each time in a distinct sense,\
hence--according to the rules of Chaucer's time, as of modern French--is\
regarded as a different rime-word each time.\
\
     Compare, also, Chaucer's _Fortune_ ("_Balades de visage sanz\
     peinture_"), made of three ballades, with one envoy; the _Balade to\
     Rosemound_ and _Moral Balade on Gentilesse_, without envoys; the\
     ballades on _Lak of Stedfastnesse_ and the _Compleint of Chaucer to\
     his Empty Purse_, with envoys addressed to the king; also the\
     ballade in the Prologue to the _Legend of Good Women_, B-text, ll.\
     249-269. The _Compleynt of Venus_, like _Fortune_, is in three\
     ballades, with one envoy, and is of special interest as being based\
     on three French ballades of Graunson.[48] Says Chaucer:\
\
        "And eek to me hit is a greet penaunce,\
        Sith rym in English hath swich scarsitee,\
        To folowe word by word the curiositee\
        Of Graunson, flour of hem that make in Fraunce."\
\
     In the Prologue to the _Legend of Good Women_, when Chaucer is\
     accused by the god of love for his translation of the _Romance of\
     the Rose_, Alcestis defends him by enumerating his other works,\
     which include:\
\
        "many an ympne for your halydayes,\
        That highten Balades, Roundels, Virelayes."\
\
    (B-text, ll. 422 f.)\
\
     On the roundels, see below; none of Chaucer's virelays have come\
     down to us. Chaucer's contemporary, John Gower, also wrote\
     ballades, but in French.\
\
    Tell me now in what hidden way is\
      Lady Flora the lovely Roman?\
    Where's Hipparcha, and where is Thais,\
      Neither of them the fairer woman?\
      Where is Echo, beheld of no man,\
    Only heard on river and mere,--\
      She whose beauty was more than human?--\
    But where are the snows of yester-year?\
\
    Where's H\'e9loise, the learned nun,\
      For whose sake Abeillard, I ween,\
    Lost manhood and put priesthood on?\
      (From love he won such dule and teen!)\
      And where, I pray you, is the Queen\
    Who willed that Buridan should steer\
      Sewed in a sack's mouth down the Seine?--\
    But where are the snows of yester-year?\
\
    White Queen Blanche, like a queen of lilies,\
      With a voice like any mermaiden,--\
    Bertha Broadfoot, Beatrice, Alice,\
      And Ermengarde the lady of Maine,--\
      And that good Joan whom Englishmen\
    At Rouen doomed and burned her there,--\
      Mother of God, where are they then?--\
    But where are the snows of yester-year?--\
\
    Nay, never ask this week, fair lord,\
      Where they are gone, nor yet this year,\
    Except with this for an overword,--\
      But where are the snows of yester-year?\
\
(ROSSETTI: _The Ballad of Dead Ladies_, from the French of Fran\'e7ois\
Villon, 1450.)\
\
This is a notable translation of a notable ballade, but it will be\
observed that it does not follow the strict rules as to the number of\
rimes. In Mr. Andrew Lang's _Ballades of Blue China_ is a formally\
correct translation.\
\
    Where are the cities of the plain?\
      And where the shrines of rapt Bethel?\
    And Calah, built of Tubal-Cain?\
      And Shinar whence King Amraphal\
      Came out in arms, and fought, and fell,\
    Decoyed into the pits of slime\
      By Siddim, and sent sheer to hell;\
    Where are the cities of old time?\
\
    Where now is Karnak, that great fane\
      With granite built, a miracle?\
    And Luxor smooth without a stain,\
      Whose graven scriptures still we spell?\
      The jackal and the owl may tell,\
    Dark snakes around their ruins climb,\
      They fade like echo in a shell;\
    Where are the cities of old time?\
\
    And where is white Shusan, again,\
      Where Vashti's beauty bore the bell,\
    And all the Jewish oil and grain\
      Were brought to Mithridath to sell,\
      Where Nehemiah would not dwell,\
    Because another town sublime\
      Decoyed him with her oracle?\
    Where are the cities of old time?\
\
    _Envoy_\
\
    Prince, with a dolorous, ceaseless knell,\
      Above their wasted toil and crime\
    The waters of oblivion swell:\
      Where are the cities of old time?\
\
(EDMUND GOSSE: _Ballad of Dead Cities._)\
\
In this ballade Mr. Gosse finely reproduces the more serious tones of\
the old form, and imitates the ancient custom of addressing the envoy to\
royalty. This _motif_, of old things lost, is a favorite one for the\
serious ballade, being suggested by Villon's _Ballade of Dead Ladies_.\
Compare Mr. Lang's _Ballade of Dead Cities_, in _Ballades of Blue\
China_.\
\
On the other hand, the next specimen illustrates the use of the form for\
the light familiarity of _vers de soci\'e9t\'e9_ and parody.\
\
    He lived in a cave by the seas,\
      He lived upon oysters and foes,\
    But his list of forbidden degrees\
      An extensive morality shows;\
      Geological evidence goes\
    To prove he had never a pan,\
      But he shaved with a shell when he chose,\
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man!\
\
    He worshipp'd the rain and the breeze,\
      He worshipp'd the river that flows,\
    And the Dawn, and the Moon, and the trees,\
      And bogies, and serpents, and crows;\
      He buried his dead with their toes\
    Tucked up, an original plan,\
      Till their knees came right under their nose,\
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man!\
\
    His communal wives, at his ease,\
      He would curb with occasional blows;\
    Or his state had a queen, like the bees\
      (As another philosopher trows):\
      When he spoke it was never in prose,\
    But he sang in a strain that would scan,\
      For (to doubt it, perchance, were morose)\
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man!\
\
    _Envoy_\
\
      Max, proudly your Aryans pose,\
    But their rigs they undoubtedly ran,\
      For, as every Darwinian knows,\
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man!\
\
(ANDREW LANG: _Ballade of Primitive Man._)\
\
In Mr. Lang's _Ballades of Blue China_ this appears as a _double\
ballade_, with three more stanzas.\
\
    From the sunny climes of France,\
      Flying to the west,\
    Came a flock of birds by chance,\
      There to sing and rest:\
      Of some secrets deep in quest,--\
    Justice for their wrongs,--\
      Seeking one to shield their breast,\
    One to write their songs.\
\
    Melodies of old romance,\
      Joy and gentle jest,\
    Notes that made the dull heart dance\
      With a merry zest;--\
      Maids in matchless beauty drest,\
    Youths in happy throngs;--\
      These they sang to tempt and test\
    One to write their songs.\
\
    In old London's wide expanse\
      Built each feathered guest,--\
    Man's small pleasure to entrance,\
      Singing him to rest,--\
      Came, and tenderly confessed,\
    Perched on leafy prongs,\
      Life were sweet if they possessed\
    One to write their songs.\
\
    _Envoy_\
\
    Austin, it was you they blest:\
      Fame to you belongs!\
    Time has proven you're the best\
      One to write their songs.\
\
(FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN: _To Austin Dobson._)\
\
Mr. Austin Dobson is said to have been the first to reintroduce the\
ballade into English poetry, and the present specimen is a tribute to\
his success by an American poet.\
\
    Bird of the bitter bright gray golden morn\
      Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years,\
    First of us all and sweetest singer born\
      Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears\
      Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears;\
    When song new-born put off the old world's attire\
    And felt its tune on her changed lips expire,\
      Writ foremost on the roll of them that came\
    Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre,\
      Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name!\
\
(SWINBURNE: _Ballad of Fran\'e7ois Villon, Prince of all Ballad-Makers_,\
st. i.)\
\
This specimen represents the ballade in ten-line stanzas.\
\
There is also an extended form of the ballade, called the _Chant Royal_,\
with five stanzas and envoy, the stanzas consisting of eleven verses.\
The usual rime-scheme is _ababccddede_, with envoy _ddede_. For\
admirable specimens, see Mr. Dobson's _Dance of Death_ and Mr. Gosse's\
_Praise of Dionysus_, in _Ballades and Rondeaus_, pp. 98, 100. Mr. White\
says of this form: "The chant royal in the old form is usually devoted\
to the unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas, the envoy supplying\
the key; but this is not always observed in modern examples. Whatever be\
the subject, however, it must always march in stately rhythm with\
splendid imagery, using all the poetic adornments of sonorous,\
highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words, to clothe a theme in\
itself a lofty one. Unless the whole poem is constructed with intense\
care, the monotony of its sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is\
unbearable." (_Ballades and Rondeaus_, Introduction, p. liv.)\
\
\
B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL\
\
_Rondel_ is the old French form of the word _rondeau_, and the terms are\
therefore naturally interchangeable. They have been applied to a number\
of different forms, all characterized by a refrain so repeated as to\
link together different parts of the structure. Two of these forms are\
particularly familiar. The first (called more commonly the _rondel_)\
consists of fourteen lines, with only two rimes; the first two lines\
constitute the refrain, and are commonly repeated as the seventh and\
eighth and again as the thirteenth and fourteenth. The rime-scheme\
varies, but is often _ABba, abAB, abbaAB_ (the capitals indicating the\
repeated lines of the refrain). Sometimes the form is shortened to\
thirteen lines, the second line of the refrain not being repeated at the\
close. The second principal form (called more commonly the _rondeau_)\
consists of thirteen lines, with two rimes, and an unrimed refrain,\
taken from the opening words of the first line, which follows the eighth\
line and is again repeated at the end. The common rime-scheme is\
_aabba,aab (refrain), aabba (refrain)_. Both these forms are found in\
early French poetry, together with many variations. The modern\
distinction between _rondeau_ and _rondel_ is artificial but\
convenient.\

\
    Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,\
    That hast this wintres weders over-shake,\
    And driven awey the longe nightes blake!\
\
    Seynt Valentyn, that art ful hy on-lofte,\
    Thus singen smale foules for thy sake:\
    Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,\
    That hast this wintres weders over-shake.\
\
    Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte,\
    Sith ech of hem recovered hath his make;\
    Ful blisful may they singen whan they wake:\
    Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,\
    That hast this wintres weders over-shake,\
    And driven awey the longe nightes blake.\
\
(CHAUCER: _Qui bien aime a tard oublie_, in _The Parlement of Foules_,\
ll. 680-692. ab. 1380.)\
\
This is the "roundel" sung by the birds "to do Nature honour and\
plesaunce." "The note" we are told was made in France. It will be seen\
that Chaucer employs a form with three-line refrain, of which the first\
two lines are twice repeated, the last only once: _ABB,abAB,abbABB_. The\
same form is used in the three roundels of _Merciles Beaute_.\
\
    Too hard it is to sing\
      In these untuneful times,\
    When only coin can ring,\
      And no one cares for rhymes!\
\
    Alas! for him who climbs\
      To Aganippe's spring:--\
    Too hard it is to sing\
      In these untuneful times!\
\
    His kindred clip his wing;\
      His feet the critic limes;\
    If Fame her laurel bring\
      Old age his forehead rimes:--\
    Too hard it is to sing\
      In these untuneful times!\
\
(AUSTIN DOBSON: _Too hard it is to sing._)\
\
    Underneath this tablet rest,\
      Grasshopper by autumn slain,\
    Since thine airy summer nest\
      Shivers under storm and rain.\
\
    Freely let it be confessed\
      Death and slumber bring thee gain\
      Spared from winter's fret and pain,\
    Underneath this tablet rest.\
\
      Myro found thee on the plain,\
    Bore thee in her lawny breast,\
      Reared this marble tomb amain\
    To receive so small a guest!\
    Underneath this tablet rest,\
      Grasshopper by autumn slain.\
\
(EDMUND GOSSE: _After Anyte of Tegea._)\
\
In this the second line of the refrain is omitted where we should expect\
it as line eight, the scheme of the first part of the rondel being\
changed to _ABab, abbA_.\
\
    The ways of Death are soothing and serene,\
      And all the words of Death are grave and sweet.\
      From camp and church, the fireside and the street,\
    She signs to come, and strife and song have been.\
\
    A summer night descending, cool and green\
      And dark, on daytime's dust and stress and heat,\
    The ways of Death are soothing and serene,\
      And all the words of Death are grave and sweet.\
\
    O glad and sorrowful, with triumphant mien\
      And hopeful faces look upon and greet\
    This last of all your lovers, and to meet\
      Her kiss, the Comforter's, your spirit lean.--\
    The ways of Death are soothing and serene.\

\
(VOITURE: _Rondeau_, ab. 1640. In _\'8cuvres de Voiture_, ed. Ubicini,\
vol. ii. p. 314.)\
\
This is perhaps the most famous of rondeaus of the type which Voiture\
did much to make popular.\
\

    For to forgett that ons was pure\
    Wtin my hert shall still that thing\

\
(SIR THOMAS WYATT: Rondeau in Wyatt MS., reproduced in _Anglia_, vol.\
xviii. p. 478. ab. 1540.)\
\
Besides the rondeaus found in the Wyatt MS., three poems of Wyatt's,\
published in Tottel's _Songs and Sonnets_ (1557), were evidently\
intended as rondeaus (see Arber's Reprint, pp. 53, 73). The editor, not\
understanding the form or thinking it too unfamiliar to be popular,\
seems to have changed it to a sort of sonnet, omitting the refrain at\
the end and making a complete line of it as the ninth of the poem. These\
hidden rondeaus were discussed by Mr. Dobson in the _Athen\'e6um_ for 1878\
(vol. i. p. 380); see also Alscher's _Sir Thomas Wyatt und seine\
Stellung_, etc.\
\
    Thou fool! if madness be so rife,\
    That, spite of wit, thou'lt have a wife,\
    I'll tell thee what thou must expect--\
    After the honeymoon neglect,\
    All the sad days of thy whole life;\
\
    To that a world of woe and strife,\
    Which is of marriage the effect--\
    And thou thy woe's own architect,\
                      Thou fool!\
\
    Thou'lt nothing find but disrespect,\
    Ill words i' th' scolding dialect,\
    For she'll all tabor be, or fife;\
    Then prythee go and whet thy knife,\
    And from this fate thyself protect,\
                      Thou fool!\
\
(CHARLES COTTON: _Rondeau._ ab. 1675. Quoted by Guest, _English\
Rhythms_, Skeat ed., p. 645.)\
\
    A good rondeau I was induced to show\
    To some fair ladies some short while ago;\
      Well knowing their ability and taste,\
      I asked should aught be added or effaced,\
    And prayed that every fault they'd make me know.\
\
    The first did her most anxious care bestow\
    To impress one point from which I ne'er should go:\
      "Upon a good beginning must be based\
                  A good rondeau."\
\
    Zeal bid the other's choicest language glow:\
    She softly said: "Recount your weal or woe,\
      Your every subject, free from pause or haste;\
      Ne'er let your hero fail, nor be disgraced."\
    The third: "With varying emphasis should flow\
                  A good rondeau."\
\
(J. R. BEST: _Ung Bon Rondeau_, in _Rondeaulx_. Translated from the\
French, ed. 1527. 1838. Quoted in _Ballades and Rondeaus_, Introduction,\
p. xxxviii.)\
\
    Death, of thee do I make my moan,\
      Who hadst my lady away from me,\
      Nor wilt assuage thine enmity\
    Till with her life thou hast my own;\
    For since that hour my strength has flown.\
    Lo! what wrong was her life to thee,\
                      Death?\
\
    Two we were, and the heart was one;\
      Which now being dead, dead I must be,\
      Or seem alive as lifelessly\
    As in the choir the painted stone,\
                      Death!\
\
(ROSSETTI: _To Death, of his Lady_, from the French of Villon, 1450.)\
\
This represents an early short form of the rondeau.\
\
    With pipe and flute the rustic Pan\
    Of old made music sweet for man;\
      And wonder hushed the warbling bird,\
      And closer drew the calm-eyed herd,--\
    The rolling river slowlier ran.\
\
    Ah! would,--ah! would, a little span,\
    Some air of Arcady could fan\
      This age of ours, too seldom stirred\
                  With pipe and flute!\
\
    But now for gold we plot and plan;\
    And from Beersheba unto Dan\
      Apollo's self might pass unheard,\
      Or find the night-jar's note preferred.--\
    Not so it fared, when time began\
                  With pipe and flute!\
\
(AUSTIN DOBSON: _With Pipe and Flute._)\
\
    What is to come we know not. But we know\
    That what has been was good--was good to show,\
      Better to hide, and best of all to bear.\
      We are the masters of the days that were:\
    We have lived, we have loved, we have suffered--even so.\
\
    Shall we not take the ebb who had the flow?\
    Life was our friend. Now, if it be our foe--\
      Dear, though it break and spoil us!--need we care\
                                  What is to come?\
\
    Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow,\
    Or the gold weather round us mellow slow:\
      We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare\
      And we can conquer, though we may not share\
    In the rich quiet of the afterglow\
                                  What is to come.\
\
(W. E. HENLEY: _What is to Come._)\
\
    A man must live! We justify\
    Low shift and trick to treason high,\
      A little vote for a little gold,\
      To a whole senate bought and sold,\
    With this self-evident reply.\
\
    But is it so? Pray tell me why\
    Life at such cost you have to buy?\
      In what religion were you told\
        "A man must live"?\
\
    There are times when a man must die.\
    Imagine for a battle-cry\
      From soldiers with a sword to hold--\
      From soldiers with the flag unrolled--\
    This coward's whine, this liar's lie,\
        "A man must live"!\
\
(CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON: _A Man Must Live._)\
\
    A Roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,\
    With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,\
    That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear\
                  A roundel is wrought.\
\
    Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught--\
    Love, laughter, or mourning--remembrance of rapture or fear--\
    That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.\
\
    As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear--\
    Pause answers to pause, and again the same strain caught,\
    So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear,\
                     A roundel is wrought.\
\
(SWINBURNE: _The Roundel_, in _A Century of Roundels_.)\
\
Mr. Swinburne has reintroduced the old word-form "roundel," to\
distinguish this style of rondeau, of his own devising, with nine long\
lines, riming _aba, bab, aba_, the refrain riming also with the _b_\
lines.\
\
\
C.--THE VILLANELLE\
\
This highly intricate form was originally used for pastoral or idyllic\
verse, and it is commonly reserved, as Mr. Dobson observes, for subjects\
"full of sweetness and simplicity." In its typical form it consists of\
nineteen lines, divided into five groups or stanzas of three and one of\
four. There are but two rimes, and the two verses which constitute the\
refrain recur again and again, line 1 reappearing as line 6, line 12,\
and line 18, while line 3 reappears as line 9, line 15, and line 19. The\
rime scheme of all the tercets is _aba_, of the conclusion _abaa_. Those\
villanelles are considered most highly finished in which the refrain\
recurs with slightly different significations.\
\
On the history of this form, see J. Boulmier's _Les Villanelles_, Paris,\
1878. The modern development of the villanelle has been largely\
influenced by the work of Passerat (1534-1602), whose most famous\
villanelle is the following specimen:\
\
    J'ay perdu ma tourterelle;\
    Est-ce-point elle que j'oy?\
    Je veux aller apr\'e8s elle.\
\
    Tu regrettes ta femelle;\
    H\'e9las! aussy fay-je moy:\
    J'ay perdu ma tourterelle.\
\
    Si ton amour est fid\'e8le,\
    Aussy est ferme ma foy;\
    Je veux aller apr\'e8s elle.\
\
    Ta plainte se renouvelle?\
    Toujours plaindre je me doy:\
    J'ay perdu ma tourterelle.\
\
    En ne voyant plus la belle\
    Plus rien de beau je ne voy:\
    Je veux aller apr\'e8s elle.\
\
    Mort, que tant de fois j'apelle,\
    Prens ce que se donne \'e0 toy:\
    J'ai perdu ma tourterelle.\
    Je veux aller apr\'e8s elle.\
\
(JEAN PASSERAT: _Villanelle._)\
\
    When I saw you last, Rose,\
      You were only so high;--\
    How fast the time goes!\
\
    Like a bud ere it blows,\
      You just peeped at the sky,\
    When I saw you last, Rose!\
\
    Now your petals unclose,\
      Now your May-time is nigh;--\
    How fast the time goes!\
\
    And a life,--how it grows!\
      You were scarcely so shy\
    When I saw you last, Rose!\
\
    In your bosom it shows\
      There's a guest on the sly;\
    How fast the time goes!\
\
    Is it Cupid? Who knows!\
      Yet you used not to sigh,\
    When I saw you last, Rose;--\
    How fast the time goes!\
\
(AUSTIN DOBSON: _When I Saw You Last, Rose._)\
\
    A dainty thing's the Villanelle.\
      Sly, musical, a jewel in rhyme,\
    It serves its purpose passing well.\
\
    A double-clappered silver bell\
      That must be made to clink in chime,\
    A dainty thing's the Villanelle;\
\
    And if you wish to flute a spell,\
      Or ask a meeting 'neath the lime,\
    It serves its purpose passing well.\
\
    You must not ask of it the swell\
      Of organs grandiose and sublime--\
    A dainty thing's the Villanelle;\
\
    And, filled with sweetness, as a shell\
      Is filled with sound, and launched in time,\
    It serves its purpose passing well.\
\
    Still fair to see and good to smell\
      As in the quaintness of its prime,\
    A dainty thing's the Villanelle,\
    It serves its purpose passing well.\
\
(W. E. HENLEY: _Villanelle._)\
\
    Wouldst thou not be content to die\
      When low-hung fruit is hardly clinging\
    And golden Autumn passes by?\
\
    Beneath this delicate rose-gray sky,\
      While sunset bells are faintly ringing,\
    Wouldst thou not be content to die?\
\
    For wintry webs of mist on high\
      Out of the muffled earth are springing,\
    And golden Autumn passes by.\
\
    O now when pleasures fade and fly,\
      And Hope her southward flight is winging,\
    Wouldst thou not be content to die?\
\
    Lest Winter come, with wailing cry\
      His cruel icy bondage bringing,\
    When golden Autumn hath passed by;\
\
    And thou with many a tear and sigh,\
      While life her wasted hands is wringing,\
    Shall pray in vain for leave to die\
    When golden Autumn hath passed by.\
\
(EDMUND GOSSE: _Villanelle._)\
\
    Spring knocks at winter's frosty door:\
      In boughs by wild March breezes swayed\
    The bonnie bluebirds sing once more.\
\
    The brooks have burst their fetters hoar,\
      And greet with noisy glee the glade;\
    Spring knocks at winter's frosty door.\
\
    The swallow soon will northward soar,\
      The rush uplift its gleaming blade,\
    The bonnie bluebirds sing once more.\
\
    Soon sunny skies their gold will pour\
      O'er meads that breezy maples shade;\
    Spring knocks at winter's frosty door.\
\
    Along the reedy river's shore,\
      Fleet fauns will frolic unafraid,\
    The bonnie bluebirds sing once more.\
\
    And Love, the Love we lost of yore,\
      Will come to twine the myrtle braid;\
    Spring knocks at winter's frosty door,\
    The bonnie bluebirds sing once more.\
\
(CLINTON SCOLLARD: _Spring Knocks at Winter's Frosty Door._)\
\
\
D.--THE TRIOLET\
\
The triolet is really a diminutive form of the Rondeau, and was not\
originally distinguished by name. It consists of eight lines, with two\
rimes, lines 1 and 2 recurring as lines 7 and 8, and line 1 also as line\
4. The rime-scheme is _ABaAabAB_. Here, as in the villanelle, a change\
of signification in the repeated lines is thought to add to the charm of\
the form.\
\
A French specimen, from Ranchin, is cited by Mr. Gleeson White as being\
called by some "the king of triolets":\
\
    Le premier jour du mois de mai\
    Fut le plus heureux de ma vie:\
    Le beau dessein que je formai,\
    Le premier jour du mois de mai!\
    Je vous vis et je vous aimai.\
    Si ce dessein vous plut, Sylvie,\
    Le premier jour du mois de mai\
    Fut le plus heureux de ma vie.\
\
    Easy is the Triolet,\
      If you really learn to make it!\
    Once a neat refrain you get,\
    Easy is the Triolet.\
    As you see!--I pay my debt\
      With another rhyme. Deuce take it,\
    Easy is the Triolet,\
      If you really learn to make it!\
\
(W. E. HENLEY.)\
\
    Rose kissed me to-day,\
      Will she kiss me to-morrow?\
    Let it be as it may,\
    Rose kissed me to-day.\
    But the pleasure gives way\
      To a savor of sorrow;--\
    Rose kissed me to-day,--\
    _Will_ she kiss me to-morrow?\
\
    I intended an Ode,\
      And it turned to a Sonnet.\
    It began _\'e0 la mode_,\
    I intended an Ode;\
    But Rose crossed the road\
      In her latest new bonnet.\
    I intended an Ode,\
      And it turned to a Sonnet.\
\
(AUSTIN DOBSON: _Rose Leaves._)\
\
In an earlier version of this last "rose-leaf" the ode is said to have\
"turned into triolets," when Rose crossed the road "with a bunch of\
fresh violets."\
\
    A little kiss when no one sees,\
      Where is the impropriety?\
    How sweet amid the birds and bees\
    A little kiss when no one sees!\
    Nor is it wrong, the world agrees,\
      If taken with sobriety.\
    A little kiss when no one sees,\
      Where is the impropriety?\
\
(SAMUEL MINTURN PECK: _Under the Rose._)\
\
    Worldly designs, fears, hopes, farewell!\
      Farewell all earthly joys and cares!\
    On nobler thoughts my soul shall dwell!\
    Worldly designs, fears, hopes, farewell!\
    At quiet, in my peaceful cell,\
      I'll think on God, free from your snares;\
    Worldly designs, fears, hopes, farewell!\
      Farewell all earthly joys and cares!\
\
(PATRICK CAREY: in _Trivial Poems and Triolets_, 1651; reprinted by\
Scott, 1819; this triolet also quoted in _Ballades and Rondeaus_,\
Introduction, p. xxxvi.)\
\
Originally, the triolet was often used for serious sentiment. The\
present and the following specimen are rare instances of its serious use\
in English.\
\
    In his arms thy silly lamb\
      Lo! he gathers to his breast!\
    See, thou sadly bleating dam,\
    See him lift thy silly lamb!\
    Hear it cry, "How blest I am!--\
      Here is love and love is rest."\
    In his arms thy silly lamb\
      See him gather to his breast!\
\
(GEORGE MACDONALD.)\
\
\
E.--THE SESTINA\
\
This form, although originally found in Proven\'e7al like the others of the\
group, has been more used in Italy than in France, and, as the English\
form of the word indicates, was introduced into England under Italian\
influence. It was invented at the end of the thirteenth century, by the\
troubadour Arnaut Daniel, celebrated in the following specimen. The\
common form of the sestina has six stanzas of six lines each, with a\
tercet at the end. There is usually no rime, but the stanzas are based\
on six end-words, which are the same in all stanzas; in the tercet three\
of these words are used in the middle of the lines, and three at the\
ends. The order of the end-words changes in each stanza according to a\
complex system: thus (in the common modern form) if the end-words of the\
first stanza be represented by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the order in the second\
stanza will be 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3; in the third, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5; in the\
fourth, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4; in the fifth, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2; in the sixth,\
2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1. Sometimes the end-words also rime by twos and threes.\
\
    In fair Provence, the land of lute and rose,\
    Arnaut, great master of the lore of love,\
    First wrought sestines to win his lady's heart;\
    For she was deaf when simpler staves he sang,\
    And for her sake he broke the bonds of rhyme,\
    And in this subtler measure hid his woe.\
\
    "Harsh be my lines," cried Arnaut, "harsh the woe,\
    My lady, that enthroned and cruel rose,\
    Inflicts on him that made her live in rhyme!"\
    But through the metre spake the voice of Love,\
    And like a wildwood nightingale he sang\
    Who thought in crabbed lays to ease his heart.\
\
    It is not told if her untoward heart\
    Was melted by her poet's lyric woe,\
    Or if in vain so amorously he sang.\
    Perchance through crowd of dark conceits he rose\
    To nobler heights of philosophic love,\
    And crowned his later years with sterner rhyme.\
\
    This thing alone we know: the triple rhyme\
    Of him who bared his vast and passionate heart\
    To all the crossing flames of hate and love,\
    Wears in the midst of all its storm and woe--\
    As some loud morn of March may bear a rose--\
    The impress of a song that Arnaut sang.\
\
    "Smith of his mother-tongue," the Frenchman sang\
    Of Lancelot and of Galahad, the rhyme\
    That beat so bloodlike at its core of rose,\
    It stirred the sweet Francesca's gentle heart\
    To take that kiss that brought her so much woe,\
    And sealed in fire her martyrdom of love.\
\
    And Dante, full of her immortal love,\
    Stayed his drear song, and softly, fondly sang\
    As though his voice broke with that weight of woe;\
    And to this day we think of Arnaut's rhyme,\
    Whenever pity at the laboring heart\
    On fair Francesca's memory drops the rose.\
\
    Ah! sovereign Love, forgive this weaker rhyme!\
    The men of old who sang were great at heart,\
    Yet have we too known woe, and worn thy rose.\

Ballads_, Second Series, p. 46.\
\
The Virelai, which we have seen was one of the forms used by Chaucer,\
though not represented in his extant poetry, has been but slightly\
imitated in English. It was a poem of indeterminate length, composed of\
longer and shorter lines, the longer lines in each stanza riming, the\
shorter lines in the same stanza also riming, while in the succeeding\
stanza the short-line rime of the previous stanza became the long-line\
rime. The last stanza took the unrepeated rime of the first stanza as\
its new rime; so that in the whole poem each rime was used in two\
stanzas. Charles Cotton, one of whose rondeaus has been quoted, also\
wrote a virelai. A modern specimen, by Mr. John Payne, is quoted in\
_Ballades and Rondeaus_, p. 276.\
\
The Pantoum is another very interesting form belonging in this group\
rather than elsewhere, although it originated not in France but\
Malaysia. It was imitated in French by Victor Hugo and other poets, and\
through French influence has found a place in English verse. It consists\
of an indeterminate number of stanzas of four lines each, the second and\
fourth line of each stanza being repeated as the first and third of the\
succeeding stanza, while the second and fourth lines of the last stanza\
repeat the first and third lines of the first stanza. Thus the whole\
forms a sort of interwoven circle, and is used most appropriately to\
represent any kind of monotony,--the dull round of repetition. From\
_Love in Idleness_ (1883) Mr. White reprints the following admirable\
specimen:\
\
    _Monologue d'outre Tombe._\
\
    Morn and noon and night,\
      Here I lie in the ground;\
    No faintest glimmer of light,\
      No lightest whisper of sound.\

PART THREE\
\
\
\
\
THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49]\
\
\
Nearly all modern writers on the theory of verse have admitted that\
English words have no fixed syllabic quantities such as are postulated\
for the classical languages, but that English quantities, so far as they\
exist, are variable and (in part at least) subjective in character. To\
this it is true there are exceptions, chiefly among the poets, like some\
of those considered in the preceding section on Imitations of Classical\
Metres.\
\
Writers who have agreed that English words have no fixed quantities, are\
still at variance as to the relation of the element of syllabic time to\
the element of accent in English verse. Two extremes may at once be\
distinguished: that represented by the familiar statement that our\
rhythms differ from those of classical poetry in being based wholly on\
accent, and that represented most notably by the late Sidney Lanier, who\
held that syllabic time-values in English verse are as exact and regular\
(hence as accurately measurable) as the notes of music. Lanier applied\
his theory with admirable consistency, and represented all sorts of\
English verse, even that of the Anglo-Saxon period, in musical notation.\
He is almost universally regarded, however, as having been led by the\
analogy between music and poetry to carry his method to quite impossible\
lengths. The most characteristic example of this is his representation\
of the familiar "blank verse" measure in "three-four" time, each\
accented syllable being given a time-value twice as long as that of the\
adjacent unaccented syllable--a method of reading which can easily be\
shown to be contrary to all common practice. It should not be forgotten,\
however, that a debt of gratitude is owed Mr. Lanier for having been one\
of the first to emphasize adequately the fact that verse, like music, is\
_rhythmical sound_.\
\
Besides those who make English verse to depend wholly on accent, and\
those who give it time-values equally regular and measurable with those\
of music, there is a third class disposed to confuse the two elements of\
quantity and accent. Of this class was Edgar Poe, who in his essay on\
The Rationale of Verse constantly spoke of accented and unaccented\
syllables as "long" and "short," respectively, and was even disposed to\
carry the identification into Latin verse itself. This essay of Poe's\
has lately been defended by Mr. John M. Robertson, in the interesting\
Appendix to his _New Essays toward a Critical Method_ (1897).\
Unfortunately Mr. Robertson seems to have perpetuated deliberately the\
confusion which he found in Poe in the use of the terms "accent" and\
"quantity." He even says that the attempt to distinguish them is\
ill-founded, "that quantity in speaking _must_ amount substantially to\
the same thing as stress," and, again, that "Poe's identification of\
stress with length is perfectly sound." Whatever be the fundamental fact\
here, the use of terms cannot be commended. If quantity is swallowed up\
in accent, so that accent alone dominates our verse, that is one thing;\
if the conditions are such that a heavy stress and a long quantity\
nearly always coincide, that is also a possible doctrine; but that is\
not to say that the two things should be identified. If all tall men\
wear long coats, or if all men--tall and short--wear long coats, it\
follows in neither case that tallness and long-coatedness are the same\
thing. It is a mere matter of physics that duration of sound and\
intensity of sound are perfectly distinguishable, and that they have no\
necessary connection with each other. The problem is: how are they\
related in practice?\
\
It has already been observed that Mr. Lanier did good service in\
emphasizing the analogy between music and poetry, but that he carried\
the analogy too far. It may, therefore, be worth while to consider at\
just this point the elements of likeness and of difference in the two\
forms of art. Both are forms of _rhythmical_ art: music and verse are\
alike rhythmical sound. Lanier showed with sufficient certainty that\
rhythm is dependent upon both _time_ and _accent_. He said, to be sure,\
that "time is _the_ essential" element;[50] but this does not seem to\
have been altogether what he meant, for he himself pointed out that the\
ear insistently marks off time-elements by the sense of variation of\
stress, even when there is no real variation, as in the tick-tack of the\
clock. He also pointed out that accent marks the rhythm of music quite\
as truly as that of verse, the rule being that ordinarily the first note\
of each measure shall receive a special stress. It seems, then, that the\
rhythm of music is based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal\
time-intervals. The same thing is true of the rhythm of verse. For every\
kind of metre there is a normal verse-rhythm which is present in the\
mind as the basis on which the verse is built up, no matter how many\
variations may constantly occur. This normal rhythm is formed by a\
succession of accents at exactly equal time-intervals,[51] such as can\
be marked off by a metronome, or by the mechanical beating of the foot\
on the floor. We realize that the verse as commonly read frequently\
departs from this regularity of intervals; but without the regularity as\
a norm to which to refer it, we should not recognize it as verse. The\
normal accent-interval we call a "foot."\
\
Exception must therefore be taken, it seems to me, to another contention\
of Mr. Robertson's; namely, that "there is no time-unit." "Our feet," he\
says, "are a pure convention, and the sole rhythmic fact is the\
fluctuant relativity of long and short, or stress and slur." I am glad\
to be able to believe that the fundamental rhythmic fact is something\
more definite than this.[52] But the latest writer on the subject, Mr.\
Mark Liddell, in his _Introduction to the Scientific Study of Poetry_,\
joins Mr. Robertson in finding no feet in English verse. Nay, he\
represents the metrist who makes use of the old conventions of\
rhythmical measurement as one who will "flounder ceaselessly amid the\
scattered timbers of iambuses, spondees, dactyls, tribrachs, never\
reaching the firm ground of truth"! Mr. Liddell points out that we do\
not pronounce English words, even in verse, with mechanically regular\
alternations of stress; and he rejects the explanation that there is\
nevertheless a typical form in the poet's and the reader's mind, on the\
ground that it is "a strange state of affairs that the \'e6sthetically\
imperfect should produce a greater pleasure than the \'e6sthetically\
perfect." Strange, perhaps, but as familiar as sunrise, if by\
"\'e6sthetically perfect" we mean absolutely regular. Here we need to recur\
to the analogy of music, where the phenomenon in question is so obvious.\
Let any one attempt to follow a symphony with a metronome in his hand,\
and he will soon discover that if the metronome represents the\
\'e6sthetically perfect rhythm, the orchestra represents a more pleasurable\
imperfection. Its accelerations and retardations carry on a continual\
conflict with the typical time of the music, yet that typical time is\
not only printed on every sheet, but is in the mind of every player. It\
is precisely so with verse.\
\
It is true, of course, that the variations from regularity of rhythm are\
more numerous and conspicuous in verse than in music. The reason is\
obvious: the sounds of verse have constantly to effect a compromise\
between the typical rhythm to which they are set and the irregular\
stress-and time-variations of human speech, while music has no such\
complicated task. Lyrical verse, being closest to music, keeps the\
typical rhythm freest from interruption; and it is worthy of remark that\
Mr. Liddell's study of English rhythms is based very largely on those of\
a non-lyrical character, although he himself points out (p. 271) that\
these are the least regular. The drama is dominated, most of all forms\
of verse, by the necessity of representing natural human speech; hence\
it is not the place to look for the fundamental laws of verse at their\
purest.\
\
There is, then, a unit of time on which all verse-rhythms, like all\
musical rhythms, are based; and this is what we commonly call in music\
the _measure_, and in verse, the _foot_, I shall recur to this matter a\
little later in considering the terminology of the subject; for the\
present let us return to the relations of verse and music. Both, we have\
seen, are based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal\
time-intervals. There is some difference, however, in the emphasis which\
one naturally places on the respective parts of the statement. In music\
we feel that the fact of chief importance is that the measures shall be\
equal in time, while the recurring accent seems a mere means of marking\
this equality; but in verse we feel that the chief fact is that the\
accents shall recur, the equality of time-intervals being in a sense a\
secondary source of pleasure. In music, therefore, as we have seen, we\
treat departures from regularity of time-intervals as somewhat more\
exceptional than in verse. But the rhythm would suffer, would even\
disappear, were either element wholly removed.\
\
If we look for further distinctions between verse and music, we find\
them in the separate sounds which go to make up the unit-measures. Not\
only are the measures of music of mathematically equal length, but all\
the sounds bear exact time-relations to each other: each is either half\
as long, or twice as long, or a quarter as long, or four times as long,\
as its neighbor. On the other hand, the number of separate sounds in the\
measure constantly varies; it is sufficient that the total length be\
that of the full measure. In verse these conditions are reversed. The\
separate syllables, while they doubtless vary in length, are not\
mathematically co\'f6rdinated as to duration by the ordinary reader. It is\
almost as difficult to say just what the time-relation of any two\
adjacent syllables is, as to be sure that one is stressed just twice as\
strongly as the other. On the other hand, the _number_ of syllables in\
the foot (in good modern English verse) is tolerably constant.\
\
For the sake of completeness, one may add two other fundamental\
distinctions which, _apart_ from the elements of rhythm, differentiate\
verse from music. Music, apart from rhythm, characteristically depends\
on variation of pitch, and only incidentally (as in the case of the use\
of different instruments in orchestration) on variation of\
sound-quality; whereas verse, apart from rhythm, characteristically\
depends on variation of sound-quality,--that is, on the different sounds\
of the different words,--and only incidentally on changes of pitch.\
Finally, the changing sounds of music are only vaguely symbolic, while\
the changing sounds of verse are symbolic of definite ideas.\
\
For the sake of easy comparison we may put these observations in a rough\
sort of table:\
\
                MUSIC                                  VERSE\

    variation of _pitch_ (incidentally     variation of sound-_quality_\

\
    Sounds vaguely symbolic.               Sounds symbolic of definite ideas.\
\
Let us now consider more closely the time-values of the separate\
syllables of verse, asking just what we mean by a "long" or a "short"\
syllable in English. It has already been indicated that the ear\
recognizes no such fixed proportions in the length of our syllables as\
are recognized for musical notes, or as are postulated for the syllables\
of Greek and Latin verse. It must also be remembered that the terms\
"long" and "short," as commonly used of English vowels, are of little\
significance for the matter of real quantity. They are applied for\
historical reasons, and do not describe present facts. Thus we call the\
_o_ in "hotel" _long_, and that in "cot" short; but it is fairly clear\
that the _o_ of "cot" takes rather more time, as commonly uttered, than\
that of "hotel." The so-called "short _o_" is, in fact, a sound so open\
that it has lost the _o_-quality. In the same way what we call "long\
_a_" is a short-_e_ sound diphthongized. We cannot be said to preserve\
in modern English any single vowels with fixed long quantity, such as we\
hear in German words like _Saal_ and _See_,--sounds which obviously take\
more time in utterance than others.\
\
Can we speak accurately, then, of long syllables and short syllables in\
modern English? It may be said that we have a large number of genuine\
diphthongs; and such double sounds, especially where they are so open as\
to require unusual effort on the part of the vocal organs (like _-ow_,\
for example), may be assumed to take a longer time in utterance than\
monophthongs. Even such a sound as is represented by _-au_ or _-aw_,\
though it has but slight diphthongal quality, seems to sound longer than\
most monophthongs. But in none of these cases does ordinary\
pronunciation make the sound-length at all conspicuous, except where it\
coincides with strong stress; and it requires a moment's reasoning to\
convince one's self that the vowel in _fine_ is any longer than that in\
_fan_. It is more than doubtful, then, whether our vowel sounds can be\
regarded as of significance for metrical time. A word like "saw" or\
"now," occurring in such a place in the verse as to be passed over with\
the briefest and lightest utterance, would be pronounced with rapidity\
by the ordinary reader, with no thought that the vowel-sound was too\
"long."\
\
But in the earlier languages a syllable might be long, not only from the\
presence of a long vowel, but also from the presence of two or more\
consonants following the vowel. May this be said to hold good for modern\
English? In general, prolonged consonantal sounds seem to be avoided, as\
in the case of vowels. We pass over them rapidly, and have, for\
instance, no such clearly stopped syllables due to double consonants as\
are heard in Italian words like _madonna_. Yet we cannot doubt that two\
or three consonants require more time than one, and in words like\
_strength_, _flushed_, _fists_, and the like, every one would find the\
consonantal length perceptible. More than this, two consonants often\
serve to "close" the preceding syllable, by making it impossible to run\
the consonant at the end of it over into the following syllable, and\
hence really lengthen it. This, of course, is the reason why the first\
syllable of the Latin _avis_ is said to be short, but that of _alvus_ to\
be long. The Elizabethan metrists tried to apply these Latin rules of\
"quantity by position" to all English words; and many modern English\
writers, who have been trained from childhood in the appreciation of\
Latin quantities, easily perceive the differing consonantal quantities\
of English words. These quantities may, then, certainly be said to\
exist; but in ordinary English pronunciation, and to the ordinary,\
untrained English ear, they must be strongly marked in order to attract\
attention. When thus strongly marked, they doubtless play some part in\
the structure of verse. In some lines attributed to Raleigh,\
\
    "His desire is a dureless content,\
      And a trustless joy,"\
\
the syllable _trust_-occupies the time of two syllables; the typical\
metre would require something like\
\
    "And a pitiless joy."\
\
Now, the fact that _trust_-is a noticeably long syllable, especially\
when closed by the following _l_, makes it well fitted to fill the place\
of two syllables; and we should find the line distinctly less pleasing\
if a short syllable were there instead. _Boundless_ would do as well,\
because equally long; _trusty_ would not be quite so good; _silly_ would\
be very bad. Conversely, when a noticeably long syllable occupies the\
place of a light syllable, in rapid tri-syllabic verse, we feel that\
the verse is injured. Mr. William Larminie criticises a line of Mr.\
Swinburne's on this ground,--\
\
    "Time sheds them like snow on strange regions;"[53]\
\
the combination _-ange_, with its final _-nj_ sound, made still longer\
by the following _r_, and preceded, too, by the combination _n-st_, has\
too much quantity for the place where it stands in the verse. In the\
verse of inferior writers many worse cases could easily be found. These\
illustrations, then, may serve to show that while we do not co\'f6rdinate\
our consonantal syllable-lengths as absolute "shorts" and "longs," we\
perceive certain degrees of length, and find these playing a part in our\
verse.\
\
So much for intrinsic quantity as found in English syllables. But there\
is much more to be said for syllables made long or short at the will of\
the speaker, under certain conditions. If we address a friend in\
surprise, saying, "_Why, John!_" we not only throw a heavy stress on\
both the words, but also perceptibly prolong them. In like manner, we\
realize that unimportant words, especially proclitics (like the\
italicized words in the phrase "_The_ land _of the_ free") are not only\
unstressed, but are hurried over in shorter moments than the accented\
words. Examples like this suggest what may in fact be expressed in a\
general statement, that accented syllables are very commonly prolonged.\
This is not, as we have seen, from any essential connection between the\
nature of accent and the nature of quantity. In certain cases,\
unaccented syllables even show a tendency to length beyond that of those\
bearing the stress, as in words like _follow_, _dying_, and others where\
the final sound is easily prolonged. The coincidence of stress and\
length, then, is due simply to the operation of the same cause--the\
grammatical or rhetorical importance of the syllable in question. This\
fact, that the important (stressed) syllables are likely to be held a\
little longer than the others, will not warrant us in representing them\
as _twice_ as long, in the exact mathematical relations of musical\
notes; but it may explain why a musician like Lanier tried to represent\
them in such notation. It must also be the cause of Mr. Robertson's\
attempt to identify quantity and stress. His statement that "quantity in\
fact, in spoken verse, consists of stress _and_ of the consonantal total\
of syllables," may be regarded as much more satisfactory than those\
already quoted from his essay. It is, however, not quite accurate.\
\
Still another kind of relative syllable-length remains to be considered,\
and for metrical purposes it is probably the most important. The\
_accents_ of English words not only vary in degree according to the\
different stresses which they receive in different prose sentences, but\
in verse they are made artificially to vary also so as to conform as\
closely as possible to the scheme of the metre. Thus the first syllable\
of the word _over_ is accented far more strongly when it occurs at the\
opening of a dactylic verse,\
\
    "Over the ocean wave,"\
\
than when it occurs at the opening of an anapestic verse,\
\
    "Over land, over sea."\
\
This being the case with accent, which tends to be strongly fixed in\
English words, we might naturally expect that it would be still more\
clearly the case with the element of time; and so it is. Syllables will\
be lengthened and shortened by the reader in order to preserve as nearly\
as possible the fundamental equal time-intervals between the principal\
accents. This is most easily recognized, and most commonly practised, in\
the case where syllables are shortened because there are more of them\
than the normal scheme of the verse would imply. The old "tumbling\
verse" of our ancestors depended on this principle, and so did the\
revival of it in Coleridge's _Christabel_. For example:\
\
    "A little door she opened straight,\
    All in the middle of the gate,\
    The gate that was ironed within and without,\
    Where an army in battle array had marched out."\
\
Here the rhythm of the last verse is brought into the four-beat measure\
of the first verse, by passing lightly and rapidly over all syllables\
save the four that mark the metre. In prose, the word _marched_ would be\
stressed quite as much as the word _out_, but there is no difficulty in\
reducing the stress in reading the verse.[54] It cannot be said,\
however, that there is no difficulty in reducing its _length_, for the\
final consonant combination _-cht_ takes up considerable time, and the\
whole word follows a syllable (_had_) which has been closed and so\
lengthened by the _d + m_. Sensitive readers would probably agree,\
therefore, that the quantity in this verse is too much for the\
smoothness of the rhythm. On the other hand, the long syllable _ironed_\
helps us to fill the place of the light syllable which is missing after\
it, and we find the rhythm easier than it would be in this form:\
\
    "The gate that was ironed both within and without."\
\
Once more, for the sake of convenience, let us attempt to put our\
conclusions into the form of a summary. An English syllable may be said\
to be _long_, not absolutely but _relatively_, from:\
\
    [1. The naturally long character of its vowel-sound, due either\
          to open quality or diphthongization.]\
\
    2. The presence of two or more consonants which require a\
          perceptible time for utterance.\
\
    3. Prolongation by the speaker\
          (_a_) because of the importance of the syllable, or\
          (_b_) because of the time which it ought to occupy in\
                    the scheme of the verse.\
\
The artificial lengthening and shortening of syllables, then, is\
constantly and naturally practised in the reading of verse which has a\
strong lyrical swing such as guides the reader into a sense of its\
structure. In verse more subtle and less lyrical in character the\
time-intervals are not so strongly marked, and by the ear not trained to\
listen for rhythm they are not so easily observed. The five-stress\
iambic line, especially when unrimed, has developed far more freedom and\
subtlety in English poetry than any other measure, and it is to this\
that one finds these writers invariably turning who wish to prove that\
our verse is not based on regular time-intervals. A verse like this:\
\
    "The lone couch of his everlasting sleep,"\
\
if read as an ordinary prose phrase, has no obvious metrical character.\
The second foot ("couch of") inverts the normal order of accent and\
no-accent, and in common speech the second and third syllables would be\
long and followed by a phrase-pause, while the fourth and fifth\
syllables would be made very short and jointed closely to what follows.\
There is no rhythm in such a group of words. But when we know that they\
are part of a poem in five-stress verse, we can readjust them so as to\
approach more closely to the rhythmical scheme in our minds. We cannot\
accent either _of_ or _his_, without destroying the sense; nor can we\
deprive either _lone_ or _couch_ of its accent; but we can _lengthen_\
the words _of his_ beyond their natural time in speech, pronouncing them\
more deliberately, and we can also, perhaps, diminish the phrase-pause\
after _couch_. This would tend to equalize the five time-intervals to\
which the verse, as a verse, should fit itself. It would be too much to\
say that this is what the ordinary reader would do, because the ordinary\
reader is likely to have his mind fixed on expressing the sense,\
neglecting the rhythm which is equally an element of the poetry; but it\
is what the careful reader could do without difficulty.\
\
The first line of _Paradise Lost_,\
\
    "Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit,"\
\
always a favorite specimen for metrists to dissect, is of like\
character. Mr. Robertson, in the essay already cited, makes considerable\
use of this verse as showing the vanity of the usual method of dividing\
verses into equal feet. He quotes approvingly Professor Shairp's account\
of the way in which Clough analyzed the line: "The two feet 'first\
disobe-' took up the time of four syllables, two iambic feet: the voice\
rested awhile on the word 'first'; then passed swiftly over 'diso-,'\
then rested again on 'be-' so as to recover the previous hurry." Now\
this seems to be merely a description of the way in which the words\
would be uttered in prose, and to neglect the rhythm of the poem in\
which they stand. In the second foot one can and should give the\
syllable _dis-_ full syllabic time, instead of hurrying over it as in\
prose speech,--a rendering made easy by the fact that it frequently has\
a marked secondary accent. Conversely, one can give _first_ somewhat\
less time than it would occupy in prose, without thereby diminishing\
its accent. The word _and_, in the fourth foot, would in prose utterance\
be allowed almost no time-value; and it may be treated in the same way\
in the verse, by permitting the pause at the comma to fill up the normal\
time of the foot. It would seem to be better, however, to give _and_ a\
fairly distinct utterance for metrical purposes (without, of course,\
adding any stress), and thus to approach more closely to the scheme of\
time-intervals. It is highly improbable that any one would read this\
verse--or almost any other verse of _Paradise Lost_--with such exact\
observance of the equal time-intervals as would appear in regular\
lyrical poetry. We have already seen that blank verse departs more\
constantly from the typical scheme of the measure than any other of our\
verse-forms. Nevertheless, the reader with a well-trained ear listens\
always for the flow of the typical metre underneath the surface\
irregularities, and, by a delicate adjustment of syllable-lengths, can\
bring the poet's words into far more rhythmical utterance than they\
would find in prose.\
\
There is one other method of varying the time-elements in verse which\
has already been suggested by what was said of the pause at the comma in\
the line of _Paradise Lost_. It will be seen very generally that light\
syllables, such as one wishes to utter in brief periods of time, are\
found on either side of the phrase-pauses in our verse.\
\
    "The first in valor, as the first in place"\
\
is a typical line in this respect. The natural pause, indicated by the\
comma, takes up part of the time of the third foot, which there are no\
syllables fitted wholly to fill. It might almost be said that, in\
ordinary five-stress verse, such verses are quite as numerous as those\
with five complete feet. The pause satisfies the ear, so far as the\
time-intervals are concerned, quite as well as a long syllable.\
\
Pauses not only fill up the incomplete time of a foot containing only\
short syllables, but they also fill the time of wholly missing\
syllables. In the verse\
\
    "Come from the dying moon, and blow"\
\
we start out with trisyllabic rhythm, but have only two syllables in the\
second and in the third foot. It does not seem certain whether the\
missing syllable after _dying_ is to have its place filled by a pause or\
by a prolongation of either or both of the syllables _dy-ing_--perhaps\
by all three means combined. In the same way the missing syllable after\
_moon_ may have its place filled either by the prolongation of the _oo_,\
or by the pause indicated by the comma, or by both. But in other cases\
the pause occupies the entire syllable-moment; for examples, see under\
Pauses in pages 20-22 above. The whole matter was well summed up in\
Lanier's saying that "rhythm may be dependent on silences" as well as on\
sounds.\
\
Let us now try to gather what we have been considering into the form of\
definite statements regarding the place of the time-element in our\
verse.\
\
1. _In the normal verse, accents appear at equal time-intervals._ This,\
of course, does not preclude all manner of variations; the unit of\
measure is not the distance between the accents as they are found in\
each verse, but between the points where they belong in the typical\
metre.\
\
2. _There is a tendency toward the coincidence of long and accented, and\
of short and unaccented, syllables._ This we have seen to be true in two\
different senses. In the first place, an accented syllable is likely to\
be lengthened for the same reason that it is accented--because of its\
relative importance in the place where it stands. In the second place,\
syllables noticeably long are avoided in those places in the verse where\
the accent does not fall, and are preferred where the stress is heavy.\
\
3. _In the reading of verse, the length of the syllables is varied\
artificially, so as to tend to preserve the equal time-intervals._\
\
4. _In like manner, pauses are introduced where syllables are short or\
wanting, to preserve these intervals._\
\
It is quite possible that these laws might be stated more fully and\
definitely. In Anglo-Saxon verse the conditions were perhaps not so\
different from those of modern English as we are likely to think; there\
we know that the principal stresses of the verse always fell on long\
syllables, and scholars like Sievers, by analyzing the remains of our\
early poetry, have formulated certain other laws as to the position and\
relations of the short syllables. If similar laws were to be formulated\
for our modern verse, we should probably find them no more perplexing\
than our ancestors would find those we have formulated for their verse.\
In every case the "law" is only an attempt to express what the ear has\
long known and obeyed. Mr. Goodell, in an article on "Quantity in\
English Verse," in the _Proceedings of the American Philological\
Society_ for 1885, attempted to do for our verse what has just been\
suggested. He stated such laws as these:\
\
"The thesis becomes a triseme if the next syllable bears the ictus. No\
syllable can be placed in this position which is incapable of\
prolongation."\
\
"If the arsis is monosyllabic, a short vowel in the thesis followed by a\
single consonant is not lengthened by the ictus; the arsis is instead\
prolonged."\
\
"With arsis monosyllabic, the strong tendency is to make the thesis\
short."\
\
Perhaps these rules are on the right track; the terminology is somewhat\
difficult, and makes one hesitate to criticise carefully. But since, as\
we have seen, the terms "long" and "short," as applied to English\
syllables, have come to be so purely relative, since our syllabic\
quantities vary so much at the will of the reader, and since the whole\
matter of the reading of our verse is in good measure one of subjective\
interpretation, it seems very doubtful whether any statements more\
explicit than those already laid down would be found of practical\
service.\
\
Finally, we come back to the question whether we shall use for English\
verse the classical terminology which has for so long been applied to\
it. Those who object to such terminology do so either on the ground that\
it implies that English accented and unaccented syllables are equivalent\
respectively to Latin long and short syllables, or on the still more\
fundamental ground that there is nothing in our verse which can properly\
be called a "foot." It is undoubtedly true that the use of terms based\
on quantity has given rise to some confusion when applied to phenomena\
based on accent, yet the terms are now understood with as fair a degree\
of clearness as any terms relating to so disputed a subject as English\
verse; and it seems very doubtful whether it is not easier to explain\
them than to introduce new ones. Experiments in the latter direction\
have not been very successful. The latest writer on the subject objects,\
with considerable severity, to the classical nomenclature "hardly\
pressed and barbarously misapplied." Our current prosody, he says later,\
"ignores" the frequent occurrence of an accented syllable at the\
beginning of a line of Shakspere's verse, "turning it off with the\
statement that 'a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse.'" Yet when we\
reach the summary of the author's discussion of the subject, we find the\
same phenomenon "turned off" with this statement: "In rising rhythm a\
thought-moment may begin with a falling wave-group." One cannot avoid\
querying whether this interesting combination of words conveys any\
simpler and better idea to the normal English reader than the familiar\
statement that "a trochaic foot may begin an iambic verse." The case is\
instructive as to the danger of attempting a new terminology where one\
is already established, and of imagining that one has thereby made the\
discussion of the subject more scientific.\
\
The second of the objections to the usual terminology, that there is no\
real _foot_ in English verse, has already been considered. If there are\
no regular units of measure in our verse, then to attempt constantly to\
find such units, and to use terms that imply their existence, is\
certainly a mistake. But those are on the wrong track who would find the\
divisions of the verse in the natural phrase-divisions of English\
speech.[55] In "_arma virumque cano_" the syllable _vi-_ is far more\
closely connected with the syllable _-rum_, for all prose purposes, than\
with the preceding syllables; but in the verse the Romans thought of it\
as being in the same foot with _arma_; and later in the verse the last\
syllable of _cano_ is rhythmically connected (over the barrier of a\
comma) with the first of _Troj\'e6_. Indeed, the Latin poets instinctively\
avoided the regular coincidence of metrical units with word or sentence\
units. Precisely the same thing is true of English verse. It has been\
suggested more than once that the great preponderance, among English\
dissyllables, of those accented on the first syllable, goes to explain\
our preference for iambic over trochaic measures; and that one reason\
why the rhythm of _Hiawatha_, for example, so soon wearies the ear, is\
because its metrical divisions and word divisions so frequently\
coincide. The fundamental principle of verse is that it sets up a new\
order of progress which constantly conflicts with, yet without\
destroying, the order of progress of common prose speech.\
\
So the _foot_ means, not a unit of measure for the words, but for the\
syllables viewed as rhythmical sound; and the attempt has already been\
made to show that it represents the time-interval between the regularly\
recurring accents of the normal metre. When there are two syllables in\
the interval, it is convenient to call the foot an iambus, a trochee, a\
pyrrhic, or a spondee; when there are three, it is convenient to call\
the foot an anapest or a dactyl. According to this system, the number of\
feet in the metre will always depend on the number of regularly\
recurring accents, which of course is not the case in classical prosody.\
For the same reason, all exceptional feet can be named by one of the six\
terms indicated, except where (as in Swinburne's "Choriambics") some\
classical metre is deliberately imitated. There is no sufficient reason\
for speaking of the choriambus as occurring in Shakspere's verse,\
because where four syllables occur in such succession as to form a sort\
of choriambus, they will be found to fill the place of _two_ ordinary\
feet, not of one; hence it would be irrational to combine them into one\
exceptional foot. But on this matter of convenience in the terminology\
of verse, one cannot do better than to refer the reader to Mr. Mayor's\
_Chapters on English Metre_, where a refreshingly simple system is set\
forth, such as will not break down under any reasonable test.\
\
There is one defect, it may be freely admitted, in these classical names\
of feet. They provide no place for the secondary accent. A foot made up\
of a fully accented plus a slightly accented syllable must be called\
either a spondee (the second syllable being thought of as approaching\
the stress of the first) or a trochee (the syllable being thought of as\
approaching no stress). The abundant use of secondary or compromised\
accents--and one might say, too, of secondary or compromised\
quantities--is a Germanic characteristic, for which no classical\
terminology can provide. There is, theoretically, room for some new\
names of feet recognizing these ambiguous syllables. Yet since degrees\
of accent are purely relative, and no two readers would be sure of\
agreeing as to which syllables are fully stressed, and which are\
half-stressed, it is not likely that such additional terms would make\
our terminology any more exact for practical purposes. The present\
system does, in fact, represent a characteristic feature of modern\
English as distinguished from early English verse; namely, that our\
metres strive after a regular alternation of stress and no-stress, and\
that the ear imagines this alternation even where (if it were a matter\
of prose utterance) it can scarcely be said to exist.\
\
It would be absurd to strive with any warmth for the classical system of\
terminology in English prosody. It is undoubtedly not an ideal system,\
nor such a one as we should adopt if we were naming everything anew; few\
existing terminologies are. The only object of the present defence of\
its carefully limited use is to show that it does stand for some\
fundamental facts in our verse, and to suggest that it is usually wiser\
to make the best of the vocabulary we have than to fly to one we know\
not of. The important thing, in any case, is not the question of terms,\
but the end that we should not lose hold of the musical rhythms of our\
verse, made up of delicately adjusted elements of accent and time.\

account of his experiments relating to the subject, given in the\

conclusion that, in order to awaken the sense of rhythm, it is necessary\
that "the accents in a line shall recur at regular intervals."\

[53] See Mr. Larminie's article on "The Development of English Metres"\
in the _Contemporary Review_ for November, 1894. In this article there\
is one of the clearest statements of the place of quantity in our verse\
that one can easily find. Mr. Larminie seems disposed, however, to place\
too much stress on the element of fixed or natural quantity, and\
sometimes to use the terms "long" and "short" with merely traditional\
meanings. The most characteristic feature of his discussion is, that he\
establishes certain principles of quantity, and judges the poets by\
their conformity to these principles. The inductive method is less\
pretentious and perhaps safer: to inquire what the poets do, and how in\
the reading of their verse we may preserve the rhythm which they\
undoubtedly had in mind. Both methods are legitimate. One will lay down\
rules for the poet, another for the reader; and there is perhaps as much\
chance of one being followed as of the other.\
\
[54] At least no difficulty has generally been found; but Mr. Liddell\
marks the word as one which _must_ be stressed from its grammatical\
importance. He even finds Coleridge untrue to the metre in putting\
_where_ in an unstressed place in the verse, on the ground that it means\
"through which." It would perhaps be safe to guess that no\
unsophisticated English reader has ever found difficulty in the accents\
of the line in question. The matter is worthy of remark as illustrating\
the tendency of one class of readers to emphasize _sense_-reading at the\
expense of rhythm. On the other hand, for an illustration of the\
opposite extreme see Professor Bright's article on "Grammatical Ictus in\
English Verse," in the Furnivall _Miscellany_ (1901), where we are told,\
in effect, that the metrical accent must always triumph over the\
sense-accent. As usual, the truth seems to lie somewhere between the\
extremes.\
\
[55] This seems to be a part of the old effort to seek a grammatical\
rather than a musical origin for metre. On this subject the reader\
should see the brilliant discussion of Professor Gummere in _The\
Beginnings of Poetry_, from which a few paragraphs are quoted in Part\
Four.\

\
THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY\
\
\
     The following extracts from important critical discussions are\
     selected with reference to their bearing on two questions: Is metre\
     an essential or only an incidental element of poetry? and, What are\
     its functions in the total content and effect of poetry? The\
     student of the subject will do well to analyze the answers to the\
     second question, determining under how many aspects of the metrical\
     element they can be grouped.\
\
Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them\
lying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted\
in man from childhood.... Next, there is the instinct for harmony and\
rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore,\
starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special\
aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.\
\
(ARISTOTLE: _Poetics_, iv. Butcher's translation, pp. 15, 17.)\
\
\
Poetry, music, and dancing constitute in Aristotle a group by\
themselves, their common element being imitation by means of\
rhythm--rhythm which admits of being applied to words, sounds, and the\
movements of the body. The history of these arts bears out the views we\
find expressed in Greek writers upon the theory of music; it is a\
witness to the primitive unity of music and poetry, and to the close\
alliance of the two with dancing.... The intimate fusion of the three\
arts afterward known as the "musical" arts--or rather we should perhaps\
say, the alliance of music and dancing under the supremacy of\
poetry--was exhibited even in the person of the artist. The office of\
the poet as teacher of the chorus demanded a practical knowledge of all\
that passed under the term "dancing," including steps, gestures,\
attitudes, and the varied resources of rhythmical movement.... The poet,\
lyric or dramatic, composed the accompaniment as well as wrote the\
verses; and it was made a reproach against Euripides, who was the first\
to deviate from the established usage, that he sought the aid of Iophon,\
son of Sophocles, in the musical setting of his dramas. The very word\
"poet" in classical times often implies the twofold character of poet\
and musician, and in later writers is sometimes used, like our\
"composer," in a strictly limited reference to music.\
\
Aristotle does full justice to the force of rhythmic form and movement\
in the arts of music and dancing. The instinctive love of melody and\
rhythm is, again, one of the two causes to which he traces the origin of\
poetry, but he lays little stress on this element in estimating the\
finished products of the poetic art. In the _Rhetoric_ he observes that\
if a sentence has metre it will be poetry; but this is said in a popular\
way. It was doubtless the received opinion, but it is one which he twice\
combats in the _Poetics_, insisting that it is not metrical form that\
makes a poem....\
\
The general question whether metre is necessary for poetical expression\
has been raised by many modern critics and poets, and has sometimes been\
answered in the negative, as by Sidney, Shelley, Wordsworth. It is,\
however, worth observing that from Aristotle's point of view, which was\
mainly one of observation, the question to be determined was rather as\
to the vehicle or medium of literary _mimesis_; and so far as the\
_mimesis_ doctrine is concerned, it is undeniable that some kinds of\
imaginative subject-matter are better expressed in prose, some in verse,\
and that Aristotle, who had before him experimental examples of writings\
poetic in spirit, but not metrical in form, had sufficient grounds for\
advocating an extension of meaning for the term _poietes_. But as\
regards the _Art_ of Poetry, his reasoning does not lead us to conclude\
that he would have reckoned the authors of prose dialogues or romances\
among poets strictly so called. As Mr. Courthope truly says, "he does\
not attempt to prove that metre is not a necessary accompaniment of the\
higher conceptions of poetry," and he, "therefore, cannot be ranged with\
those who support that extreme opinion." Still there would appear to be\
some want of firmness in the position he takes up as to the place and\
importance of metre. In his definition of tragedy (chap. vi. 2)\
"embellished language" is included among the constituent elements of\
tragedy; and the phrase is then explained to mean language that has the\
twofold charm of metre (which is a branch of rhythm) and of melody. But\
these elements are placed in a subordinate rank and are hardly treated\
as essentials. They are in this respect not unlike scenery or\
spectacular effect, which, though deduced by Aristotle from the\
definition, is not explicitly mentioned in it. The essence of the poetry\
is the "imitation"; the melody and the verse are the "seasoning" of the\
language.... Aristotle, highly as he rates the \'e6sthetic capacity of the\
sense of hearing in his treatment of music, says nothing to show that he\
values at its proper worth the power of rhythmical sound as factor in\
poetry; and this is the more striking in a Greek, whose enjoyment of\
poetry came through the ear rather than the eye, and for whom poetry was\
so largely associated with music. After all, there can hardly be a\
greater difference between two ways of saying the same thing than that\
one is said in verse, the other in prose. There are some lyrics which\
have lived and will always live by their musical charm, and by a strange\
magic that lies in the setting of the words. We need not agree with a\
certain modern school who would empty all poetry of poetical thought and\
etherealize it till it melts into a strain of music; who sing to us we\
hardly know of what, but in such a way that the echoes of the real\
world, its men and women, its actual stir and conflict, are faint and\
hardly to be discerned. The poetry, we are told, resides not in the\
ideas conveyed, not in the blending of soul and sense, but in the sound\
itself, in the cadence of the verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it\
is not perhaps more false than that other which wholly ignores the\
effect of musical sound and looks only to the thought that is conveyed.\
Aristotle comes perilously near this doctrine.\
\

\
\
It is not riming and versing that maketh a poet, no more than a long\
gown maketh an advocate; who, though he pleaded in armor, should be an\
advocate and no soldier. But it is that feigning notable images of\
virtues, vices, or what else, with that delightful teaching which must\
be the right describing note to know a poet by; although, indeed, the\
senate of poets hath chosen verse as their fittest raiment, meaning, as\
in matter they passed all in all, so in manner to go beyond them: not\
speaking (table-talk fashion, or like men in a dream) words as they\
chanceably fell from the mouth, but poyzing each syllable of each word\
by just proportion according to the dignity of the subject....\
\
It is already said (and as I think, truly said) it is not riming and\
versing that maketh poesy.... But yet, presuppose it were inseparable\
(as, indeed, it seemeth Scaliger judgeth) truly it were an inseparable\
commendation. For if _oratio_ next to _ratio_, speech next to reason, be\
the greatest gift bestowed upon mortality, that cannot be praiseless,\
which doth most polish that blessing of speech, which considers each\
word, not only (as a man may say) by his forcible quality, but by his\
measured quantity, carrying even in themselves a harmony, without\
(perchance) number, measure, order, proportion, be in our time grown\
odious. But lay aside the just praise it hath, by being the only fit\
speech for music (music, I say, the most divine striker of the senses);\
thus much is undoubtedly true, that if reading be foolish, without\
remembering, memory being the only treasurer of knowledge, those words\
which are fittest for memory are likewise most convenient for knowledge.\
Now, that verse far exceedeth prose in the knitting up of the memory,\
the reason is manifest. The words (besides their delight, which hath a\
great affinity to memory), being so set, as one word cannot be lost, but\
the whole work fails, which accuseth itself, calleth the remembrance\
back to itself, and so most strongly confirmeth it. Besides, one word\
so as it were begetting another, as be it in rime or measured verse, by\
the former a man shall have a near guess to the follower.... So that,\
verse being in itself sweet and orderly, and being best for memory, the\
only handle of knowledge, it must be in jest that any man can speak\
against it.\
\
(SIR PHILIP SIDNEY: _An Apologie for Poetrie_.)\
\
\
Versification, or the art of modulating his numbers, is indispensably\
necessary to a poet. Every other power by which the understanding is\
enlightened, or the imagination enchanted, may be exercised in prose.\
But the poet has this peculiar superiority, that to all the powers which\
the perfection of every other composition can require, he adds the\
faculty of joining music with reason, and of acting at once upon the\
senses and the passions. I suppose there are few who do not feel\
themselves touched by poetical melody, and who will not confess that\
they are more or less moved by the same thoughts, as they are conveyed\
by different sounds, and more affected by the same words in one order\
than another. The perception of harmony is, indeed, conferred upon men\
in degrees very unequal; but there are none who do not perceive it, or\
to whom a regular series of proportionate sounds cannot give delight.\
\
(SAMUEL JOHNSON: _The Rambler_, No. 86.)\
\
\
Various causes might be pointed out why, when the style is manly, and\
the subject of some importance, words metrically arranged will long\
continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who proves the\
extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart. The end of poetry is\
to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of pleasure;\
but, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of\
the mind; ideas and feelings do not, in that state, succeed each other\
in accustomed order.... Now the co-presence of something regular,\
something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in\
a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and\
restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling, and of\
feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion. This is\
unquestionably true; and hence, though the opinion will at first appear\
paradoxical, from the tendency of metre to divest language, in a certain\
degree, of its reality, and thus to throw a sort of half-consciousness\
of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition, there can be\
little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments--that is,\
those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them--may\
be endured in metrical composition, especially in rime, than in\
prose.... This opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the\
reader's own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the\
reperusal of the distressful parts of _Clarissa Harlowe_, or the\
_Gamester_; while Shakspere's writings, in the most pathetic scenes,\
never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure--an effect\
which, in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined, is to\
be ascribed to small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable\
surprise from the metrical arrangement.[56] On the other hand (what it\
must be allowed will much more frequently happen), if the poet's words\
should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to raise the\
reader to a height of desirable excitement, then (unless the poet's\
choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious), in the feelings of\
pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in\
general, and in the feeling, whether cheerful or melancholy, which he\
has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre,\
there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart\
passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the poet\
proposes to himself.\
\
If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory here maintained,\
it would have been my duty to develop the various causes upon which the\
pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of\
these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to\
those who have made any of the Arts the object of accurate reflection;\
namely, the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of\
similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the\
activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.... It would not be a\
useless employment to apply this principle to the consideration of\
metre, and to show that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure,\
and to point out in what manner that pleasure is produced. But my limits\
will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must content myself\
with a general summary.\
\
I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful\
feelings; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity;\
the emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the\
tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which\
was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does\
itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition\
generally begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but\
the emotion, of whatever kind, and in whatever degree, from various\
causes, is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any\
passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will,\
upon the whole, be in a state of enjoyment. If Nature be thus cautious\
to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so employed, the Poet ought\
to profit by the lesson held forth to him, and ought especially to take\
care that, whatever passions he communicates to his reader, those\
passions, if his reader's mind be sound and vigorous, should always be\
accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of harmonious\
metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind\
association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of\
rime or metre of the same or similar construction, an indistinct\
perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of\
real life, and yet, in the circumstance of metre, differing from it so\
widely--all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight,\
which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling\
always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper\
passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned\
poetry; while, in lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness with\
which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a\
principal source of the gratification of the reader. All that it is\
necessary to say, however, upon this subject, may be effected by\
affirming, what few persons will deny, that of two descriptions, either\
of passions, manners, or characters, each of them equally well executed,\
the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse will be read a\
hundred times where the prose is read once.\
\
(WORDSWORTH: Preface to the _Lyrical Ballads_, 2d ed.)\
\
\
The true question must be,[57] whether there are not modes of\
expression, a construction, and an order of sentences, which are in\
their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition, but would be\
disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry; and, _vice\
versa_, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be an\
arrangement both of words and sentences, and a use and selection of\
(what are called) figures of speech, both as to their kind, their\
frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject of equal weight would\
be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend that in both\
cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other frequently will\
and ought to exist. And, first, from the origin of metre. This I would\
trace to the balance in the mind effected by the spontaneous effort\
which strives to hold in check the workings of passion. It might be\
easily explained likewise in what manner this salutary antagonism is\
assisted by the very state which it counteracts; and how this balance\
of antagonists became organized into metre (in the usual acceptation of\
that term) by a supervening act of the will and judgment, consciously\
and for the foreseen purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles as\
the data of our argument, we deduce from them two legitimate conditions,\
which the critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work. First,\
that as the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of\
increased excitement, so the metre itself should be accompanied by the\
natural language of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements are\
formed into metre artificially, by a voluntary act, with the design and\
for the purpose of blending delight with emotion, so the traces of\
present volition should throughout the metrical language be\
proportionally discernible....\
\
Secondly, I argue from the effects of metre. As far as metre acts in and\
for itself, it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of\
the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it produces by\
the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick reciprocations of\
curiosity still gratified and still re-excited, which are too slight\
indeed to be at any moment objects of distinct consciousness, yet become\
considerable in their aggregate influence. As a medicated atmosphere, or\
as wine during animated conversation, they act powerfully, though\
themselves unnoticed. Where, therefore, correspondent food and\
appropriate matter are not provided for the attention and feelings thus\
roused, there must needs be disappointment felt;--like that of leaping\
in the dark from the last step of a staircase, when we had prepared our\
muscles for a leap of three or four.\
\
The discussion on the powers of metre, in the Preface, is highly\
ingenious, and touches at all points on truth. But I cannot find any\
statement of its powers considered abstractly and separately. On the\
contrary, Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers\
which it exerts during (and, as I think, in consequence of) its\
combination with other elements of poetry. Thus the previous difficulty\
is left unanswered, what the elements are with which it must be combined\
in order to produce its own effects to any pleasurable purpose.... For\
any poetic purposes, metre resembles (if the aptness of the simile may\
excuse its meanness) yeast, worthless or disagreeable by itself, but\
giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is proportionally\
combined....\
\
Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention, and therefore\
excites the question, Why is the attention to be thus stimulated? Now\
the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself; for\
this we have shown to be conditional, and dependent on the\
appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions to which the metrical\
form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be\
rationally given, short of this: I write in metre, because I am about to\
use a language different from that of prose....\
\
Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned\
which render metre the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect and\
defective without metre. Metre, therefore, having been connected with\
poetry most often, and by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined\
with metre must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have\
nevertheless some property in common with poetry, as an intermedium of\
affinity.\
\
(COLERIDGE: _Biographia Literaria_, chap. xviii.)\
\
\
In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and imitate natural\
objects, observing in these actions, as in all others, a certain rhythm\
or order. And, although all men observe a similar, they observe not the\
same order, in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the song, in\
the combinations of language, in the series of their imitations of\
natural objects. For there is a certain order or rhythm belonging to\
each of these classes of mimetic representation, from which the hearer\
and the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure than from any\
other: the sense of an approximation to this order has been called taste\
by modern writers....\
\
Language, color, form, and religious and civil habits of action are all\
the instruments and materials of poetry; and they may be called poetry\
by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the\
cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those\
arrangements of language, and especially metrical language, which are\
created by that imperial faculty whose throne is curtained within the\
invisible nature of man. And this springs from the nature itself of\
language, which is a more direct representation of the actions and\
passions of our internal being, and is susceptible of more various and\
delicate combinations than color, form, or motion, and is more plastic\
and obedient to the control of that faculty of which it is the\
creation.... Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each\
other and towards that which they represent, and a perception of the\
order of those relations has always been found connected with a\
perception of the order of the relations of thoughts. Hence the language\
of poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence\
of sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely less\
indispensable to the communication of its influence than the words\
themselves, without reference to that peculiar order.... An observation\
of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony in the language of\
poetical minds, together with its relation to music, produced metre, or\
a certain system of traditional forms of harmony and language. Yet it is\
by no means essential that a poet should accommodate his language to\
this traditional form, so that the harmony, which is its spirit, be\
observed.\
\
(SHELLEY: _A Defence of Poetry_.)\
\
\
Poetry, in its matter and form, is natural imagery or feeling, combined\
with passion and fancy. In its mode of conveyance, it combines the\
ordinary use of language with musical expression. There is a question of\
long standing in what the essence of poetry consists, or what it is that\
determines why one set of ideas should be expressed in prose, another in\
verse. Milton has told us his idea of poetry in a single line:\
\
    "Thoughts that voluntary move\
    Harmonious numbers."\
\
As there are certain sounds that excite certain movements, and the song\
and dance go together, so there are, no doubt, certain thoughts that\
lead to certain tones of voice, or modulations of sound, and change "the\
words of Mercury into the songs of Apollo." ... The jerks, the breaks,\
the inequalities and harshnesses of prose are fatal to the flow of a\
poetical imagination, as a jolting road or a stumbling horse disturbs\
the reverie of an absent man. But poetry "makes these odds all even." It\
is the music of language, answering to the music of the mind, untying,\
as it were, "the secret soul of harmony." Wherever any object takes such\
a hold of the mind as to make us dwell upon it, and brood over it,\
melting the heart in tenderness, or kindling it to a sentiment of\
enthusiasm; wherever a movement of imagination or passion is impressed\
on the mind, by which it seeks to prolong and repeat the emotion, to\
bring all other objects into accord with it, and to give the same\
movement of harmony, sustained and continuous, or gradually varied,\
according to the occasion, to the sounds that express it--this is\
poetry. The musical in sound is the sustained and continuous; the\
musical in thought is the sustained and continuous also. There is a near\
connection between music and deep-rooted passion. Mad people sing. As\
often as articulation passes naturally into intonation, there poetry\
begins.... It is to supply the inherent defect of harmony in the\
customary mechanism of language, to make the sound an echo to the sense,\
when the sense becomes a sort of echo to itself--to mingle the tide of\
verse, "the golden cadences of poetry," with the tide of feeling,\
flowing and murmuring as it flows--in short, to take the language of the\
imagination from off the ground; and enable it to spread its wings where\
it may indulge its own impulses:\
\
    "Sailing with supreme dominion\
    Through the azure deep of air,"\
\
without being stopped, or fretted, or diverted with the abruptnesses and\
petty obstacles, and discordant flats and sharps of prose, that poetry\
was invented. It is to common language what springs are to a carriage,\
or wings to feet. In ordinary speech we arrive at a certain harmony by\
the modulations of the voice; in poetry the same thing is done\
systematically by a regular collocation of syllables. It has been well\
observed, that every one who declaims warmly, or grows intent upon a\
subject, rises into a sort of blank verse or measured prose.... An\
excuse might be made for rime in the same manner. It is but fair that\
the ear should linger on the sounds that delight it, or avail itself of\
the same brilliant coincidence and unexpected recurrence of syllables,\
that have been displayed in the invention and collocation of images. It\
is allowed that rime assists the memory.... But if the jingle of names\
assists the memory, may it not also quicken the fancy?\
\
(WILLIAM HAZLITT: _On Poetry in General_.)\
\
\
With regard to the principle of Variety in Uniformity by which verses\
ought to be modulated, and oneness of impression diversely produced, it\
has been contended by some that poetry need not be written in verse at\
all; that prose is as good a medium, provided poetry be conveyed through\
it, and that to think otherwise is to confound letter with spirit, or\
form with essence. But the opinion is a prosaical mistake. Fitness and\
unfitness for _song_, or metrical excitement, just make all the\
difference between a poetical and prosaical subject; and the reason why\
verse is necessary to the form of poetry is that the perfection of\
poetical spirit demands it--that the circle of its enthusiasm, beauty,\
and power is incomplete without it. I do not mean that a poet can never\
show himself a poet in prose; but that being one, his desire and\
necessity will be to write in verse; and that, if he were unable to do\
so, he would not and could not deserve his title. Verse to the true poet\
is no clog. It is idly called a trammel and a difficulty. It is a help.\
It springs from the same enthusiasm as the rest of his impulses, and is\
necessary to their satisfaction and effect.... Verse is the final proof\
to the poet that his mastery over his art is complete. It is the\
shutting up of his powers in "_measureful_ content"; the answer of form\
to his spirit; of strength and ease to his guidance.... Verse, in short,\
is that finishing, and rounding, and "tuneful planeting" of the poet's\
creations which is produced of necessity by the smooth tendencies of\
their energy or inward working, and the harmonious dance into which they\
are attracted round the orb of the beautiful. Poetry, in its complete\
sympathy with beauty, must of necessity leave no sense of the beautiful,\
and no power over its forms, unmanifested; and verse flows as inevitably\
from this condition of its integrity as other laws of proportion do from\
any other kind of embodiment of beauty....\
\
Every poet, then, is a versifier; every fine poet an excellent one; and\
he is the best whose verse exhibits the greatest amount of strength,\
sweetness, straightforwardness, unsuperfluousness, variety, and\
oneness;--oneness, that is to say, consistency in the general\
impression, metrical and moral; and variety, or every pertinent\
diversity of tone and rhythm, in the process.... It is thus that\
versification itself becomes part of the sentiment of a poem, and\
vindicates the pains that have been taken to show its importance. I know\
of no very fine versification unaccompanied with fine poetry; no poetry\
of a mean order accompanied with verse of the highest.\
\
(LEIGH HUNT: _What is Poetry?_ Cook ed., pp. 37-40, 61.)\
\
\
No literary expression can, properly speaking, be called poetry that is\
not in a certain deep sense emotional, whatever may be its\
subject-matter, concrete in its method and its diction, rhythmical in\
movement, and artistic in form.... That poetry must be metrical or even\
rhythmical in movement, however, is what some have denied. Here we touch\
at once the very root of the subject.... While prose requires\
intellectual life and emotional life, poetry seems to require not only\
intellectual life and emotional life but rhythmic life.... Unless the\
rhythm of any metrical passage is so vigorous, so natural, and so free\
that it seems as though it could live, if need were, by its rhythm\
alone, has that passage any right to exist? and should it not, if the\
substance is good, be forthwith demetricized and turned into prose? ...\
Aristotle ignored, and Plato slighted, the importance of versification\
(though Plato on one occasion admitted that he who did not know rhythm\
could be called neither musician nor poet).... On the whole, however,\
the theory that versification is not an indispensable requisite of a\
poem seems to have become nearly obsolete in our time. Perhaps, indeed,\
many critics would now go so far in the contrary direction as to say\
with Hegel (_\'c6sthetik_, iii. p. 289) that "metre is the first and only\
condition absolutely demanded by poetry, yea even more necessary than a\
figurative picturesque diction."\
\
(THEODORE WATTS: Article on "Poetry" in _Encyclop\'e6dia Britannica_.)\
\
\
Verse-rhythm in words is the imposition of a _sensible_ order on what\
naturally and normally has only a _logical_ order; and there is piquancy\
in the feeling that so little is this ideal control a fettering\
instrument, that each order seems to gain verve and spontaneity from the\
other, or rather from the latent sense that the other, though present\
and operative, is powerless to hamper it. Much more important, however,\
is it to notice how the sense that one single thing--the word-series--is\
lending itself to this joint dominance may take the form of a sort of\
transfigured surprise. (The root-principle here involved is the old one\
of "unity in variety," the _single_ line of words, "dominated at once by\
the idea which they express in their grammatical connection and by their\
metrical adjustment," clearly possessing _two_ independent functions or\
aspects. See the fuller discussion of "The Sound-element in Verse," in\
chapter xix. of _The Power of Sound_.) ... When, as in verse, the sounds\
are pointedly addressed _both_ to the ear and to the understanding, the\
rarity of the combination of aspects contributes a strain of feeling\
partly akin to that with which we follow an exhibition of skill, and\
partly to that with which we receive an unexpected gratuity....\
\
Nor is this all. Rhythm perpetually not only transfigures the poetical\
expression of an idea, but makes the existence of that expression\
possible. This is tolerably obvious in the case of what is often called\
_par excellence_ poetical language--language which keeps clear of\
prosaic homeliness and prosaic precision and of technical and abstract\
terms, and confines itself to a more picturesque and loftier\
vocabulary.... Clearly it is the rarity of rhythmic, as compared with\
non-rhythmic, speech that supports such rarity of poetic as compared\
with non-poetic diction; that is to say, verse, being in one\
respect--namely, its effect on the ear--a marked exception from ordinary\
language, thereby establishes for itself the means of being exceptional,\
without seeming unnatural, in other ways....\
\
... In dwelling on the non-reasonable part in poetical beauty, I am in\
no way committed to the assertion that all its constituents are excluded\
from prose, but only to the assertion that the metrical form makes a\
difference of kind. It cannot be for nothing that the very idea of\
"poetical prose" inspires dread; and the instances of prose-writing\
where we find delight of the intangible and non-reasonable kind are\
exceptions that only prove the rule. One has but to test by\
self-examination the living force of words in a specimen of verse and of\
poetical prose which may respectively seem to oneself first-rate of\
their kind. For such typical passages may often be regarded as fairly on\
a par in respect of the ideas and emotions which they reasonably\
express; and the prose may unquestionably further resemble the poetry in\
a certain subtle individuality of life in its more prominent words, so\
far as this life can be quickened in them by the idea itself, aided by\
such qualities of sound-arrangement as are possible apart from metre. So\
far the poetical merits of the respective passages may be equal; yet\
only one of them is Poetry.... Language, which in prose does little more\
than transmit thought, like clear glass, becomes--even as that\
becomes--by art's adjustments and the moulding of measured form, a lens,\
where the thought takes fire as it passes. The poet speaks through a\
medium which seems to intensify the point and to extend the range of\
what he would tell us by some power outside his own volition. Such a\
power, in fact, a rhythmic order, in its fundamental appeal to human\
nerves, literally is.... The _ictus_ of the verse comes upon us as the\
operative force which shocks the words into their unwonted life.\
\
... In considering the total contribution of metre to imaginative\
language, it is impossible to overlook the quality of _permanence_. I do\
not mean permanence merely in the sense that metrical words live in the\
memory.... This is, of course, a most important fact; but I am here\
dealing only with elements of effect that enter into the actual moment\
of enjoyment.... It is a sense of combined parts, and their\
indispensableness one to another, which gives us a sense of permanence\
in an arch as compared with a casual heap of stones; it is a similar\
indispensableness which gives to metrical language an air of permanence\
impossible even to the most harmonious sentence whose sounds conform to\
no genuine scheme. And again, in the case of this constituent as of the\
others, we have no difficulty in seeing that its influence is really a\
joint one of sound and sense--that, though founded in the nature of\
metrical sound as such, it is not merely a sound-quality superposed _ab\
extra_ on the intelligible beauty of the words, but depends for its\
existence on their intelligible character.... We cannot glory in the\
enshrining for memory of things that we do not care to remember. But for\
that which is of true spiritual significance the fairly-fitted body of\
sound is greeted as the inevitable investiture; and thus justified and\
quickened, the strength of the mutually indispensable parts seems no\
longer that of mere structure but of organic life.\
\
(EDMUND GURNEY: Essay on "Poets, Critics, and Class-Lists," in _Tertium\
Quid_, vol. ii. pp. 162-179, _passim_.)\
\
\
Why have poets always written in metre? The answer is, Because the laws\
of artistic expression oblige them to do so. When the poet has been\
inspired from without in the way in which we saw Scott was inspired to\
conceive the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_--that is to say, when he has\
found his subject-matter in an idea, universally striking to the\
imagination, when he has received this into his own imagination, and has\
given it a new and beautiful form of life there, then he will seek to\
express his conception through a vehicle of language harmonizing with\
his own feelings and the nature of the subject, and this kind of\
language is called verse. For example, when Marlowe wishes to represent\
the emotions of Faustus, after he has called up the phantom of Helen of\
Troy, it is plain that some very rapturous form of expression is needed\
to convey an adequate idea of such famous beauty. Marlowe rises to the\
occasion in those "mighty lines" of his:\
\
    "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,\
    And burned the topless towers of Ilium?"\
\
But it is certain that he could only have ventured on the sublime\
audacity of saying that a face launched ships and burned towers by\
escaping from the limits of ordinary language, and conveying his\
metaphor through the harmonious and ecstatic movements of rhythm and\
metre....\
\
I think Wordsworth's analysis of emotion is clearly wrong. The reason\
why the harrowing descriptions of Richardson are simply painful, while\
Shakspere's tragic situations are pleasurable, is that the imagination\
shrinks from dwelling on ideas so closely imitated from real objects as\
the scenes in _Clarissa Harlowe_, but contemplates without excess of\
pain the situation in _Othello_, for example, because the imitation is\
poetical and ideal. Prose is used by Richardson because his novel\
professedly resembles a situation of real life; metre is needed by\
Shakspere to make the ideal life of his drama real to the imagination.\
Wordsworth, if I may say so, has put the poetical cart before the\
horse....\
\
The propriety of poetical expression is the test and the touch-stone of\
the justice of poetical conception.... Poetry lies in the invention of\
the right metrical form--be it epic, dramatic, lyric, or satiric--for\
the expression of some idea universally interesting to the imagination.\
When the form of metrical expression seems _natural_--natural, that is,\
to the genius of the poet and the inherent character of the\
subject--then the subject-matter will have been rightly conceived....\
Apply this test of what is natural in metrical expression to any\
composition claiming to be poetically inspired, and you will be able to\
decide whether it fulfils the universal conditions of poetical life, or\
whether it is one of those phantoms, or, as Bacon calls them, idols of\
the imagination, which vanish as soon as the novelty of their appearance\
has exhausted its effect. For instance, the American poet, Walt Whitman,\
announces his theme, and asks for the sympathy of the reader in these\
words:\
\
    "Oneself I sing, a simple, separate person,\
    Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En Masse.\
    Poets to come, orators, singers, musicians to come,\
    Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,\
    But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than\
        before known,\
    Arouse! for you must justify me!..."\
\
To this appeal I think the reader may reply: The subject you have chosen\
is certainly an idol of the imagination. For if you had anything of\
universal interest to say about yourself, you could say it in a way\
natural to one of the metres, or metrical movements, established in the\
English language. What you call metre bears precisely the same relation\
to these universal laws of expression, as the Mormon church and the\
religion of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young bear to the doctrines of\
Catholic Christendom.[58] ...\
\
Why do we so often find men in these days, either using metre ... where\
they ought to have expressed themselves in prose, or expressing\
themselves in verse in a style so far remote from the standard of\
diction established in society that they fail to touch the heart? I\
think the explanation of this curious phenomenon is that, though metre\
can only properly be used for the expression of universal ideas, there\
is in modern society an eccentric or monastic principle at work, which\
leads men to pervert metre into a luxurious instrument for the\
expression of merely private ideas.\
\
(WILLIAM JOHN COURTHOPE: _Life in Poetry, Law in Taste_, pp. 71-83.)\
\
\
Language is colloquial and declarative in our ordinary speech, and on\
its legs for common use and movement. Only when it takes wings does it\
become poetry. As the poet, touched by emotion, rises to enthusiasm and\
imaginative power or skill, his speech grows _rhythmic_, and thus puts\
on the attribute that distinguishes it from every other mode of artistic\
expression--the guild-mark which, rightly considered, establishes the\
nature of the thing itself.... Our new empiricism, following where\
intuition leads the way, comprehends the function of _vibrations_: it\
perceives that every movement of matter, seized upon by universal force,\
is _vibratory_; that vibrations, and nothing else, convey through the\
body the look and voice of nature to the soul; that thus alone can one\
incarnate individuality address its fellow; that, to use old Bunyan's\
imagery, these vibrations knock at the ear-gate, and are visible to the\
eye-gate, and are sentient at the gates of touch of the living temple.\
The word describing their action is in evidence; they "thrill" the body,\
they thrill the soul, both of which respond with subjective,\
interblending vibrations, according to the keys, the wave-lengths, of\
their excitants. Thus it is absolutely true that what Buxton Forman\
calls "idealized language,"--that is, speech which is imaginative and\
rhythmical,--goes with emotional thought; and that words exert a\
mysterious and potent influence, thus chosen and assorted, beyond their\
normal meanings....\
\
Aside from the vibratory mission of rhythm, its little staff of\
adjuvants, by the very discipline and limitations which they impose,\
take poetry out of the plane of common speech, and make it an art which\
lifts the hearer to its own unusual key. Schiller writes to Goethe that\
"rhythm, in a dramatic work, treats all characters and all situations\
according to one law.... In this manner it forms the atmosphere for the\
poetic creation. The more material part is left out, for only what is\
spiritual can be borne by this thin element." In real, that is,\
spontaneous minstrelsy, the fittest assonance, consonance, time, even\
rime, ... come of themselves with the imaginative thought.... Such is\
the test of genuineness, the underlying principle being that the\
masterful words of all poetic tongues are for the most part in both\
their open and consonantal sounds related to their meanings, so that\
with the inarticulate rhythm of impassioned thought we have a\
correspondent verbal rhythm for its vehicle. The whole range of poetry\
which is vital, from the Hebrew psalms and prophecies, in their original\
text and in our great English version, to the Georgian lyrics and\
romances and the Victorian idyls, confirms the statement of Mill that\
"the deeper the feeling, the more characteristic and decided the\
rhythm." The rapture of the poet governs the tone and accent of his\
\
         "high and passionate thoughts\
    To their own music chanted."\
\
(EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN: _The Nature and Elements of Poetry_, pp.\
51-55.)\
\
\
We agree, then, to call by the name of poetry that form of art which\
uses rhythm to attain its ends, just as we call by the name of flying\
that motion which certain animals attain by the use of wings; that the\
feelings roused by poetry can be roused by unrhythmic order of words,\
and that rhythmic order of words is often deplorably bad art, or\
"unpoetic," have as little to do with the case as the fact that a\
greyhound speeding over the grass gives the spectator quite the\
exhilaration and sense of lightness and grace which is roused by the\
flight of a bird, and the fact that an awkward fowl makes itself\
ridiculous in trying to fly, have to do with the general proposition\
that flying is a matter of wings.... As a matter of fact, all writers on\
poetry take rhythm for granted until some one asks why it is necessary;\
whereupon considerable discussion, and the protest signed by a\
respectable minority, but a minority after all, that rhythm is not an\
essential condition of the poetic art. This discussion, as every one\
knows, has been lively and at times bitter. A patient and comprehensive\
review of it in a fairly impartial spirit has led to the conclusion,\
first, that no test save rhythm has been proposed which can be put to\
real use, even in theory, not to mention the long reaches of a\
historical and comparative study; secondly, that all defenders of the\
poem in prose are more or less contradictory and inconsistent, making\
confusion between theory and practice; and thirdly, that advocates of a\
rhythmic test, even in abstract definition, seem to have the better of\
the argument....\
\
All reports of primitive singing, that is, of singing among races on a\
low plane of culture, make rhythm a wholly insistent element of the\
verse.... Rhythm is obscured or hidden by declamation only in times when\
the eye has usurped the functions of the ear, and when a highly\
developed prose makes the accented rhythm of poetry seem either\
old-fashioned or a sign of childhood. Not that one wishes to restore a\
sing-song reading, but rather a recognition of metrical structure, of\
those subtle effects in rhythm which mean so much in the poet's art;\
verse, in a word, particularly lyric verse, must not be read as if it\
were prose. Dramatic verse is a difficult problem.... For in drama one\
wishes nowadays to hear not rhythm, but the thought, the story, the\
point.... As thought recedes, as one comes nearer to those primitive\
emotions which were untroubled by thought, they get expression more and\
more in cadenced tones. And again, this cadenced emotional expression,\
as it grows stronger, grows wider; the barriers of irony and reserve,\
which keep a modern theatre tearless in the face of Lear's most pathetic\
utterance, break down; first, as one recedes from modern conditions,\
comes the sympathetic emotion of the spectators expressed in sighs and\
tears; ... then comes the partial activity of the spectators by their\
deputed chorus; and at last the throng of primitive times, common\
emotion in common expression, with no spectators, no audience, no\
reserve or comment of thought,--for thought is absorbed in the\
perception and action of communal consent; and here, by all evidence,\
rhythm rules supreme....\
\
If, now, the curve of evolution in Aryan verse begins with an absolutely\
strict rhythm and alternate emphasis of syllables, often, as in Iranian,\
to the neglect of logical considerations; if the course of poetry is to\
admit logical considerations more and more, forcing in at least one case\
the abandoning of movable accent and the agreement of verse-emphasis\
with syllabic-emphasis, an undisputed fact; if poetry, too, first shakes\
off the steps of dancing, then the notes of song, finally the strict\
scanning of the verse, until now recited poetry is triumphantly logical,\
with rhythm as a subconscious element; if, finally, this process exactly\
agrees with the gradual increase of thought over emotion, with the\
analogous increase of solitary poetry over gregarious poetry,--then,\
surely, one has but to trace back this curve of evolution, and to\
project it into prehistoric conditions, in order to infer with something\
very close to certitude that rhythm is the primal fact in the beginnings\
of the poetic art....\
\
The hold of rhythm upon modern poetry, even under conditions of analytic\
and intellectual development which have unquestionably worked for the\
increased importance of prose, is a hold not to be relaxed, and for good\
reason. The reason is this. In rhythm, in sounds of the human voice,\
timed to movements of the human body, mankind first discovered that\
social consent which brought the great joys and the great pains of life\
into a common utterance.... The mere fact of utterance is social;\
however solitary his thought, a poet's utterance must voice this consent\
of man with man, and his emotion must fall into rhythm, the one and\
eternal expression of consent. This, then, is why rhythm will not be\
banished from poetry so long as poetry shall remain emotional utterance;\
for rhythm is not only sign and warrant of a social contract stronger,\
deeper, vaster, than any fancied by Rousseau, but it is the expression\
of a human sense more keen even than the fear of devils and the love of\
gods--the sense and sympathy of kind.[59]\

[56] Compare with this a passage in a letter of Goethe's to Schiller\
about _Faust_: "Some tragic scenes were done in prose; by reason of\
their naturalness and strength they are quite intolerable in relation to\
the other scenes. I am, therefore, now trying to put them into rime, for\
there the idea is seen as if under a veil, and the immediate effect of\
this tremendous material is softened." (Translation of Professor F. B.\
Gummere, in _The Beginnings of Poetry_, p. 73.)\

of metre in Whitman's poems:\
\
"'Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?' inquires Mr. Whitman. ... No, my\
dear good sir: ... not in the wildest visions of a distempered slumber\
could I have dreamed of doing anything of the kind. ... But metre,\
rhythm, cadence, not merely appreciable but definable and reducible to\
rule and measurement, though we do not expect from you, we demand from\
all who claim, we discern in the works of all who have achieved, any\
place among poets of any class whatsoever.... The question is whether\
you have any more right to call yourself a poet, or to be called a poet,\
... than to call yourself or to be called, on the strength of your\
published writings, a mathematician, a logician, a painter, a political\
economist, a sculptor, a dynamiter, an old parliamentary hand, a civil\
engineer, a dealer in marine stores, an amphimacer, a triptych, a\
rhomboid, or a rectangular parallelogram."\

\
[59] Professor Gummere also gives this analysis of Karl B\'fccher's essay\
on "Labor and Rhythm" (_Arbeit und Rhythmus_, Leipzig, 1896): "Fatigue,\
which besets all work felt as work by reason of its continued\
application of purpose, vanished for primitive man, as it vanishes now\
for children, if the work was once freed from this stress of application\
and so turned to a kind of play. The dance itself is really hard work,\
exacting and violent; what makes it the favorite it is with savages as\
with children? Simply its automatic, regular, rhythmic character, the\
due repetition of a familiar movement which allows the mind to relax its\
attitude of constant purpose. The purpose and plan of work involve\
external sources and external ends; rhythm is instinctive, and springs\
from the organic nature of man; it is no invention. The song that one\
sings while at work is not something fitted to the work, but comes from\
movements of the body in the specific acts of labor; and this applies\
not only to the rhythm, but even to the words. So it was in the festal\
dance.... That poetry and music were always combined by early man, and,\
along with labor, made up the primitive three-in-one, an organic whole,\
labor being the basal fact, with rhythm as an element common to the\
three; and that not harmony or pitch, but this overmastering and\
pervasive rhythm, exact, definite, was the main factor of early\
song,--these are conclusions for which B\'fccher offers ample and\
convincing evidence." (_Ib._ pp. 108, 109.)\

APPENDIX\
\
TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET\
\
\
The following table is designed, in the first place, to illustrate the\
history of the decasyllabic couplet in English verse, by making possible\
a comparison of the characteristic details of its form in different\
periods; and, in the second place, to suggest a method by which, through\
the careful tabulation of facts, one may substantiate or correct general\
statements as to the qualities of verse.\
\
Any such statistics as are here presented must be accepted, if at all,\
with no little caution. The table is based on passages of one hundred\
lines each, believed to be fairly representative of the verse of the\
several authors. No passage of this length, however, can be known to be\
perfectly typical. A still greater difficulty is found in the\
necessarily subjective character of any such tabulation. Most lines of\
English decasyllabic verse can be read--with reference to the\
distribution of accents and pauses--in more than one way. It is\
unlikely, therefore, that any two readers would reach the same results\
in trying to form a table of this kind. The _absolute_ validity of the\
figures is therefore doubtful; but on condition that they all have been\
computed by the same person, consistently with a single standard of\
judgment, their relative validity, for purposes of _comparison_, may be\
fairly assumed.\
\
The facts here set down for each specimen of verse group themselves in\
four divisions. In the first place, each line of verse is either\
"run-on" or "end-stopped"; and, in riming couplets, it is also of\
interest to know whether the second line of the couplet is run-on into\
the following couplet. In the second place, the cesural pause occurs\
either near the middle of the line or elsewhere, or--it may be--is\
omitted altogether. In the third place, the line may have a feminine\
ending. In the fourth place, it may contain some other foot than the\
regular iambus.\
\
There is some room for difference of judgment as to whether a given line\
is "end-stopped" or "run-on"; but with occasional exceptions the\
presence or want of a mark of punctuation may be made the determining\
element. Obviously one may find such clear phrase-pauses, without\
punctuation, as will justify the caption "end-stopped."\
\
There is far more divergence of judgment in the recognition of the\
cesura. Some writers on prosody treat practically every line of ten\
syllables as having a cesural pause, and certainly some slight\
phrase-pause may almost always be found. In the following table,\
however, the cesura has been recognized only when there is a grammatical\
or rhetorical pause so considerable as--in most cases--to require a mark\
of punctuation. Such a verse, then, as--\
\
    "Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky"\
\
is counted as having "no cesura." The cesura is counted as "medial" when\
occurring after the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable; elsewhere it is\
regarded as "variant." The significance of this distinction is very\
clear in the comparison of the heroic couplet of the "classical" with\
that of the "romantic" school of poets.[60]\
\
It is in the last group of facts, those relating to substituted feet,\
that the subjective element is most embarrassing. There can be no very\
general agreement among readers as to the degree of accent necessary to\
change a pair of syllables from an "iambus" to a "pyrrhic" or a\
"spondee." The other two forms of substitution (inverted accent, giving\
"trochees," and trisyllabic feet, giving "anapests") are somewhat more\
definitely determinable. In the following table the naming of all these\
feet is based on what is believed to be the natural reading of the\
verse, with a due regard for both rhetorical and metrical accent. In the\
verse--\
\
    "By these the springs of property were bent"\
\
the fourth foot is counted a pyrrhic; so also in this--\
\
    "Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews,"\
\
although here a certain secondary accent on the eighth syllable is\
possible. In such a verse as--\
\
    "There is a path on the sea's azure floor"\
\
the third foot is counted a pyrrhic and the fourth a spondee.[61]\
\
One may get, then, from a table of this sort, a general view of the\
character of any particular piece of verse, in respect to the poet's\
preference for run-on lines, for feminine endings, for breaking the\
verse into two equal parts, for varying the cesura, or for substituting\
exceptional feet. The description would be more nearly complete if there\
were also indicated the _places_ in the verse where substituted feet\
occur; a trochee in the second foot is a very different thing from one\
in the first; but it is difficult to tabulate facts of this order\
without complicating one's results beyond the point of serviceable\
clearness.\
\
Some students of verse are doubtless offended by the use of statistics\
in connection with a subject of this kind; and it is easy to ridicule\
the obvious incongruity of mathematical methods and poetry. A recent\
magazine critic makes merry over certain statistical studies in rhythm,\
carried on in a laboratory by recording the beats in nursery-rimes on\
the one hand and in hymns on the other. "There is a certain class of\
problems," he observes most justly, "whose external aspects may possibly\
yield to statistical tabulation, but which in the last resort must be\
spiritually discerned."[62] Poetry is unquestionably of this class. Yet\
this would not seem to forbid the study, by scientific methods, of those\
"external aspects" admittedly susceptible of tabulation. One is not\
likely to recommend elementary students to count trochees and cesuras in\
order to increase their appreciation of good verse. But when one comes\
to the point of generalizing as to the laws or history of verse-forms,\
it is well to have a method of correction, representable in figures\
black and white, for the vague impressions which are all that\
appreciative reading can give. Perhaps the real service of such a method\
as has just been described is to prevent one from making hasty\
generalizations which statistics will not support.\
\
Obviously the same system can be applied to blank verse, with the\
omission of the second category in the table. A convenient method of\
making such a study is to use sheets of paper ruled for twenty-five\
lines and seven columns. Each horizontal line represents a line of verse\
analyzed. The columns are headed "Cesura," "T," "P," "S," "A," "Run-on,"\
and "Fem. Ending." A cesural pause between the third and fourth\
syllables is indicated by the figures 3/4 in the first column. A trochee\
in the first foot is indicated by the figure 1 in the "T" column; a\
spondee in the fourth foot by the figure 4 in the "S" column; and so on.\
A simple check-mark in the sixth or seventh column indicates\
respectively a case of _enjambement_ or of feminine ending. When the\
tabulation is complete, one can easily note the proportion of run-on\
lines and exceptional cesuras, and can also determine at a glance not\
only the number of exceptional feet but the parts of the verse in which\
they occur.\
\
In the following table the figures regarding the couplets of Spenser are\
based on his _Mother Hubbard's Tale_; those relating to Joseph Hall, on\
the Satires of his _Virgidemiarum_ (see p. 182); those relating to Leigh\
Hunt, on _The Story of Rimini_; those relating to Keats, on _Endymion_;\
to Browning, on _Sordello_.\

\
FOOTNOTES:\
\
[60] Here a word of caution is needed. It will be observed that the\
regularly balanced line of the classical couplet requires not only a\
medial pause, but also a pause at the end. Hence where we find, as in\
the verse of Keats, a large number of medial cesuras but at the same\
time a very large number of "run-on" lines, the characteristic effect of\
the medial pause is almost entirely lost, and the number of medial\
pauses is not significant.\
\
[61] This combination (of pyrrhic and spondee) is of course very\
frequent; and where both substitutions occur together, the general\
average of accents is maintained, only with exchange of position. On the\
other hand, where there appears a large number of pyrrhics with almost\
no spondees (as in the case of Dryden), a different sort of verse is\
indicated,--one where the lines gain a certain lightness and rapidity\
from the lack of the full number of fully accented syllables.\

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the\

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\
     License.  You must require such a user to return or\
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\
your equipment.\
\
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\
opportunities to fix the problem.\
\
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER\

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\
\

\
\
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\

\
Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit http://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\
\
\
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\
\
     http://www.gutenberg.org\
\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\

PREFACE\
\
_As this essay is disposed to consider epic poetry as a species of\
literature, and not as a department of sociology or archaeology or\
ethnology, the reader will not find it anything material to the\
discussion which may be typified in those very interesting works,\
Gilbert Murray's "The Rise of the Greek Epic" and Andrew Lang's "The\
World of Homer." The distinction between a literary and a scientific\
attitude to Homer (and all other "authentic" epic) is, I think, finally\
summed up in Mr. Mackail's "Lectures on Greek Poetry"; the following\
pages, at any rate, assume that this is so. Theories about epic origins\
were therefore indifferent to my purpose. Besides, I do not see the need\
for any theories; I think it need only be said, of any epic poem\
whatever, that it was composed by a man and transmitted by men. But this\
is not to say that investigation of the "authentic" epic poet's_ milieu\
_may not be extremely profitable; and for settling the preliminaries of\
this essay, I owe a great deal to Mr. Chadwick's profoundly\
interesting study, "The Heroic Age"; though I daresay Mr. Chadwick would\
repudiate some of my conclusions. I must also acknowledge suggestions\
taken from Mr. Macneile Dixon's learned and vigorous "English Epic and\
Heroic Poetry"; and especially the assistance of Mr. John Clark's\
"History of Epic Poetry." Mr. Clark's book is so thorough and so\
adequate that my own would certainly have been superfluous, were it not\
that I have taken a particular point of view which his method seems to\
rule out--a point of view which seemed well worth taking. This is my\
excuse, too, for considering only the most conspicuous instances of epic\
poetry. They have been discussed often enough; but not often, so far as\
I know, primarily as stages of one continuous artistic development_.\
\
\

\
\
BEGINNINGS\
\
The invention of epic poetry corresponds with a definite and, in the\
history of the world, often recurring state of society. That is to say,\
epic poetry has been invented many times and independently; but, as the\
needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the\
invention itself has been. Most nations have passed through the same\
sort of chemistry. Before their hot racial elements have been thoroughly\
compounded, and thence have cooled into the stable convenience of\
routine which is the material shape of civilization--before this has\
firmly occurred, there has usually been what is called an "Heroic Age."\
It is apt to be the hottest and most glowing stage of the process. So\
much is commonplace. Exactly what causes the racial elements of a\
nation, with all their varying properties, to flash suddenly (as it\
seems) into the splendid incandescence of an Heroic Age, and thence to\
shift again into a comparatively rigid and perhaps comparatively\
lustreless civilization--this difficult matter has been very nicely\
investigated of late, and to interesting, though not decided, result.\
But I may not concern myself with this; nor even with the detailed\
characteristics, alleged or ascertained, of the Heroic Age of nations.\
It is enough for the purpose of this book that the name "Heroic Age" is\
a good one for this stage of the business; it is obviously, and on the\
whole rightly, descriptive. For the stage displays the first vigorous\
expression, as the natural thing and without conspicuous restraint, of\
private individuality. In savagery, thought, sentiment, religion and\
social organization may be exceedingly complicated, full of the most\
subtle and strange relationships; but they exist as complete and\
determined _wholes_, each part absolutely bound up with the rest.\
Analysis has never come near them. The savage is blinded to the glaring\
incongruities of his tribal ideas not so much by habit or reverence; it\
is simply that the mere possibility of such a thing as analysis has\
never occurred to him. He thinks, he feels, he lives, all in a whole.\
Each person is the tribe in little. This may make everyone an\
astoundingly complex character; but it makes strong individuality\
impossible in savagery, since everyone accepts the same elaborate\
unanalysed whole of tribal existence. That existence, indeed, would find\
in the assertion of private individuality a serious danger; and tribal\
organization guards against this so efficiently that it is doubtless\
impossible, so long as there is no interruption from outside. In some\
obscure manner, however, savage existence has been constantly\
interrupted; and it seems as if the long-repressed forces of\
individuality then burst out into exaggerated vehemence; for the result\
(if it is not slavery) is, that a people passes from its savage to its\
heroic age, on its way to some permanence of civilization. It must\
always have taken a good deal to break up the rigidity of savage\
society. It might be the shock of enforced mixture with a totally alien\
race, the two kinds of blood, full of independent vigour, compelled to\
flow together;[1] or it might be the migration, due to economic stress,\
from one tract of country to which the tribal existence was perfectly\
adapted to another for which it was quite unsuited, with the added\
necessity of conquering the peoples found in possession. Whatever the\
cause may have been, the result is obvious: a sudden liberation, a\
delighted expansion, of numerous private individualities.\
\
But the various appearances of the Heroic Age cannot, perhaps, be\
completely generalized. What has just been written will probably do for\
the Heroic Age which produced Homer, and for that which produced the\
_Nibelungenlied, Beowulf_, and the Northern Sagas. It may, therefore\
stand as the typical case; since Homer and these Northern poems are what\
most people have in their minds when they speak of "authentic" epic. But\
decidedly Heroic Ages have occurred much later than the latest of these\
cases; and they arose out of a state of society which cannot roundly be\
called savagery. Europe, for instance, had its unmistakable Heroic Age\
when it was fighting with the Moslem, whether that warfare was a cause\
or merely an accompaniment. And the period which preceded it, the period\
after the failure of Roman civilization, was sufficiently "dark" and\
devoid of individuality, to make the sudden plenty of potent and\
splendid individuals seem a phenomenon of the same sort as that which\
has been roughly described; it can scarcely be doubted that the age\
which is exhibited in the _Poem of the Cid_, the _Song of Roland_, and\
the lays of the Crusaders (_la Chanson d'Antioche_, for instance), was\
similar in all essentials to the age we find in Homer and the\
_Nibelungenlied_. Servia, too, has its ballad-cycles of Christian and\
Mahometan warfare, which suppose an age obviously heroic. But it hardly\
falls in with our scheme; Servia, at this time, might have been expected\
to have gone well past its Heroic Age. Either, then, it was somehow\
unusually prolonged, or else the clash of the Ottoman war revived it.\
The case of Servia is interesting in another way. The songs about the\
battle of Kossovo describe Servian defeat--defeat so overwhelming that\
poetry cannot possibly translate it, and does not attempt it, into\
anything that looks like victory. Even the splendid courage of its hero\
Milos, who counters an imputation of treachery by riding in full\
daylight into the Ottoman camp and murdering the Sultan, even this\
courage is rather near to desperation. The Marko cycle--Marko whose\
betrayal of his country seems wiped out by his immense prowess--has in a\
less degree this utter defeat of Servia as its background. But Servian\
history before all this has many glories, which, one would think, would\
serve the turn of heroic song better than appalling defeat and, indeed,\
enslavement. Why is the latter celebrated and not the former? The reason\
can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is\
heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does. Servia's\
defeat by the armies of Amurath came at a time when its people was too\
strongly possessed by the heroic spirit to avoid uttering itself in\
poetry. And from this it appears, too, that when the heroic age sings,\
it primarily sings of itself, even when that means singing of its own\
humiliation.--One other exceptional kind of heroic age must just be\
mentioned, in this professedly inadequate summary. It is the kind which\
occurs quite locally and on a petty scale, with causes obscurer than\
ever. The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads,\
clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very\
circumscribed and not very important heroic age. Here the households of\
gentry take the place of courts, and the poetry in vogue there is\
perhaps instantly taken up by the taverns; or perhaps this is a case in\
which the heroes are so little removed from common folk that celebration\
of individual prowess begins among the latter, not, as seems usually to\
have happened, among the social equals of the heroes. But doubtless\
there are infinite grades in the structure of the Heroic Age.\
\
The note of the Heroic Age, then, is vehement private individuality\
freely and greatly asserting itself. The assertion is not always what we\
should call noble; but it is always forceful and unmistakable. There\
would be, no doubt, some social and religious scheme to contain the\
individual's self-assertion; but the latter, not the former, is the\
thing that counts. It is not an age that lasts for very long as a rule;\
and before there comes the state in which strong social organization and\
strong private individuality are compatible--mutually helpful instead of\
destroying one another, as they do, in opposite ways, in savagery and in\
the Heroic Age--before the state called civilization can arrive, there\
has commonly been a long passage of dark obscurity, which throws up into\
exaggerated brightness the radiance of the Heroic Age. The balance of\
private good and general welfare is at the bottom of civilized morals;\
but the morals of the Heroic Age are founded on individuality, and on\
nothing else. In Homer, for instance, it can be seen pretty clearly that\
a "good" man is simply a man of imposing, active individuality[2]; a\
"bad" man is an inefficient, undistinguished man--probably, too, like\
Thersites, ugly. It is, in fact, an absolutely aristocratic age--an age\
in which he who rules is thereby proven the "best." And from its nature\
it must be an age very heartily engaged in something; usually fighting\
whoever is near enough to be fought with, though in _Beowulf_ it seems\
to be doing something more profitable to the civilization which is to\
follow it--taming the fierceness of surrounding circumstance and man's\
primitive kind. But in any case it has a good deal of leisure; and the\
best way to prevent this from dragging heavily is (after feasting) to\
glory in the things it has done; or perhaps in the things it would like\
to have done. Hence heroic poetry. But exactly what heroic poetry was\
in its origin, probably we shall never know. It would scarcely be\
history, and it would scarcely be very ornate poetry. The first thing\
required would be to translate the prowess of champions into good and\
moving narrative; and this would be metrified, because so it becomes\
both more exciting and more easily remembered. Each succeeding bard\
would improve, according to his own notions, the material he received\
from his teachers; the prowess of the great heroes would become more and\
more astonishing, more and more calculated to keep awake the feasted\
nobles who listened to the song. In an age when writing, if it exists at\
all, is a rare and secret art, the mists of antiquity descend after a\
very few generations. There is little chance of the songs of the bards\
being checked by recorded actuality; for if anyone could write at all,\
it would be the bards themselves, who would use the mystery or purposes\
of their own trade. In quite a short time, oral tradition, in keeping of\
the bards, whose business is to purvey wonders, makes the champions\
perform easily, deeds which "the men of the present time" can only gape\
at; and every bard takes over the stock of tradition, not from original\
sources, but from the mingled fantasy and memory of the bard who came\
just before him. So that when this tradition survives at all, it\
survives in a form very different from what it was in the beginning. But\
apparently we can mark out several stages in the fortunes of the\
tradition. It is first of all court poetry, or perhaps baronial poetry;\
and it may survive as that. From this stage it may pass into possession\
of the common people, or at least into the possession of bards whose\
clients are peasants and not nobles; from being court poetry it becomes\
the poetry of cottages and taverns. It may survive as this. Finally, it\
may be taken up again by the courts, and become poetry of much greater\
sophistication and nicety than it was in either of the preceding stages.\
But each stage leaves its sign on the tradition.\
\
All this gives us what is conveniently called "epic material"; the\
material out of which epic poetry might be made. But it does not give us\
epic poetry. The world knows of a vast stock of epic material scattered\
up and down the nations; sometimes its artistic value is as\
extraordinary as its archaeological interest, but not always. Instances\
are our own Border Ballads and Robin Hood Ballads; the Servian cycles of\
the Battle of Kossovo and the prowess of Marko; the modern Greek songs\
of the revolt against Turkey (the conditions of which seem to have been\
similar to those which surrounded the growth of our riding ballads); the\
fragments of Finnish legend which were pieced together into the\
_Kalevala_; the Ossianic poetry; and perhaps some of the minor sagas\
should be put in here. Then there are the glorious Welsh stories of\
Arthur, Tristram, and the rest, and the not less glorious Irish stories\
of Deirdre and Cuchulain; both of these noble masses of legend seem to\
have only just missed the final shaping which turns epic material into\
epic poetry. For epic material, it must be repeated, is not the same\
thing as epic poetry. Epic material is fragmentary, scattered, loosely\
related, sometimes contradictory, each piece of comparatively small\
size, with no intention beyond hearty narrative. It is a heap of\
excellent stones, admirably quarried out of a great rock-face of\
stubborn experience. But for this to be worked into some great\
structure of epic poetry, the Heroic Age must be capable of producing\
individuality of much profounder nature than any of its fighting\
champions. Or rather, we should simply say that the production of epic\
poetry depends on the occurrence (always an accidental occurrence) of\
creative genius. It is quite likely that what Homer had to work on was\
nothing superior to the Arthurian legends. But Homer occurred; and the\
tales of Troy and Odysseus became incomparable poetry.\
\
An epic is not made by piecing together a set of heroic lays, adjusting\
their discrepancies and making them into a continuous narrative. An epic\
is not even a re-creation of old things; it is altogether a new\
creation, a new creation in terms of old things. And what else is any\
other poetry? The epic poet has behind him a tradition of matter and a\
tradition of style; and that is what every other poet has behind him\
too; only, for the epic poet, tradition is rather narrower, rather more\
strictly compelling. This must not be lost sight of. It is what the\
poet does with the tradition he falls in which is, artistically, the\
important thing. He takes a mass of confused splendours, and he makes\
them into something which they certainly were not before; something\
which, as we can clearly see by comparing epic poetry with mere epic\
material, the latter scarce hinted at. He makes this heap of matter into\
a grand design; he forces it to obey a single presiding unity of\
artistic purpose. Obviously, something much more potent is required for\
this than a fine skill in narrative and poetic ornament. Unity is not\
merely an external affair. There is only one thing which can master the\
perplexed stuff of epic material into unity; and that is, an ability to\
see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man's\
general destiny.\
\
It is natural that, after the epic poet has arrived, the crude epic\
material in which he worked should scarcely be heard of. It could only\
be handed on by the minstrels themselves; and their audiences would not\
be likely to listen comfortably to the old piecemeal songs after they\
had heard the familiar events fall into the magnificent ordered pomp of\
the genuine epic poet. The tradition, indeed, would start afresh with\
him; but how the novel tradition fared as it grew old with his\
successors, is difficult guesswork. We can tell, however, sometimes, in\
what stage of the epic material's development the great unifying epic\
poet occurred. Three roughly defined stages have been mentioned. Homer\
perhaps came when the epic material was still in its first stage of\
being court-poetry. Almost certainly this is when the poets of the\
Crusading lays, of the _Song of Roland_, and the _Poem of the Cid_, set\
to work. Hesiod is a clear instance of the poet who masters epic\
material after it has passed into popular possession; and the\
_Nibelungenlied_ is thought to be made out of matter that has passed\
from the people back again to the courts.\
\
Epic poetry, then, as distinct from mere epic material, is the concern\
of this book. The intention is, to determine wherein epic poetry is a\
definite species of literature, what it characteristically does for\
conscious human life, and to find out whether this species and this\
function have shown, and are likely to show, any development. It must be\
admitted, that the great unifying poet who worked on the epic material\
before him, did not always produce something which must come within the\
scope of this intention. Hesiod has just been given as an instance of\
such a poet; but his work is scarcely an epic.[3] The great sagas, too,\
I must omit. They are epic enough in primary intention, but they are not\
poetry; and I am among those who believe that there is a difference\
between poetry and prose. If epic poetry is a definite species, the\
sagas do not fall within it. But this will leave me more of the\
"authentic" epic poetry than I can possibly deal with; and I shall have\
to confine myself to its greatest examples. Before, however, proceeding\
to consider epic poetry as a whole, as a constantly recurring form of\
art, continually responding to the new needs of man's developing\
consciousness, I must go, rapidly and generally, over the "literary\
epic"; and especially I must question whether it is really justifiable\
or profitable to divide epic poetry into the two contrasted departments\
of "authentic" and "literary."\

\
LITERARY EPIC\
\
Epic poetry, then, was invented to supply the artistic demands of\
society in a certain definite and recognizable state. Or rather, it was\
the epic material which supplied that; the first epic poets gave their\
age, as genius always does, something which the age had never thought of\
asking for; which, nevertheless, when it was given, the age took good\
hold of, and found that, after all, this, too, it had wanted without\
knowing it. But as society went on towards civilization, the need for\
epic grew less and less; and its preservation, if not accidental, was an\
act of conscious aesthetic admiration rather than of unconscious\
necessity. It was preserved somehow, however; and after other kinds of\
literature had arisen as inevitably and naturally as epic, and had\
become, in their turn, things of less instant necessity than they were,\
it was found that, in the manner and purpose of epic poetry, something\
was given which was not given elsewhere; something of extraordinary\
value. Epic poetry would therefore be undertaken again; but now, of\
course, deliberately. With several different kinds of poetry to choose\
from, a man would decide that he would like best to be an epic poet, and\
he would set out, in conscious determination, on an epic poem. The\
result, good or bad, of such a determination is called "literary" epic.\
The poems of Apollonius Rhodius, Virgil, Lucan, Camoens, Tasso and\
Milton are "literary" epics. But such poetry as the _Odyssey_, the\
_Iliad,_ _Beowulf_, the _Song of Roland_, and the _Nibelungenlied_,\
poetry which seems an immediate response to some general and instant\
need in its surrounding community--such poetry is "authentic" epic.\
\
A great deal has been made of this distinction; it has almost been taken\
to divide epic poetry into two species. And, as the names commonly given\
to the two supposed species suggest, there is some notion that\
"literary" epic must be in a way inferior to "authentic" epic. The\
superstition of antiquity has something to do with this; but the\
presence of Homer among the "authentic" epics has probably still more to\
do with it. For Homer is the poet who is usually chosen to stand for\
"authentic" epic; and, by a facile association of ideas, the conspicuous\
characteristics of Homer seem to be the marks of "authentic" epic as a\
species. It is, of course, quite true, that, for sustained grandeur and\
splendour, no poet can be put beside Homer except Dante and Milton; but\
it is also quite clear that in Homer, as in Dante, and Milton, such\
conspicuous characteristics are simply the marks of peculiar poetic\
genius. If we leave Homer out, and consider poetic greatness only (the\
only important thing to consider), there is no "authentic" epic which\
can stand against _Paradise Lost_ or the _Aeneid_. Then there is the\
curious modern feeling--which is sometimes but dressed up by erroneous\
aesthetic theory (the worship of a quite national "lyricism," for\
instance) but which is really nothing but a sign of covert\
barbarism--that lengthy poetic composition is somehow undesirable; and\
Homer is thought to have had a better excuse for composing a long poem\
than Milton.\
\
But doubtless the real reason for the hard division of epic poetry into\
two classes, and for the presumed inferiority of "literary" to\
"authentic," lies in the application of that curiosity among false\
ideas, the belief in a "folk-spirit." This notion that such a thing as a\
"folk-spirit" can create art, and that the art which it does create must\
be somehow better than other art, is, I suppose, the offspring of\
democratic ideas in politics. The chief objection to it is that there\
never has been and never can be anything in actuality corresponding to\
the "folk-spirit" which this notion supposes. Poetry is the work of\
poets, not of peoples or communities; artistic creation can never be\
anything but the production of an individual mind. We may, if we like,\
think that poetry would be more "natural" if it were composed by the\
folk as the folk, and not by persons peculiarly endowed; and to think so\
is doubtless agreeable to the notion that the folk is more important\
than the individual. But there is nothing gained by thinking in this\
way, except a very illusory kind of pleasure; since it is impossible\
that the folk should ever be a poet. This indisputable axiom has been\
ignored more in theories about ballads--about epic material--than in\
theories about the epics themselves. But the belief in a real\
folk-origin for ballads, untenable though it be in a little examination,\
has had a decided effect on the common opinion of the authentic epics.\
In the first place, a poem constructed out of ballads composed, somehow\
or other, by the folk, ought to be more "natural" than a work of\
deliberate art--a "literary" epic; that is to say, these Rousseau-ish\
notions will admire it for being further from civilization and nearer to\
the noble savage; civilization being held, by some mysterious argument,\
to be deficient in "naturalness." In the second place, this belief has\
made it credible that the plain corruption of authentic epic by oral\
transmission, or very limited transmission through script, might be the\
sign of multiple authorship; for if you believe that a whole folk can\
compose a ballad, you may easily believe that a dozen poets can compose\
an epic.\
\
But all this rests on simple ignoring of the nature of poetic\
composition. The folk-origin of ballads and the multiple authorship of\
epics are heresies worse than the futilities of the Baconians; at any\
rate, they are based on the same resolute omission, and build on it a\
wilder fantasy. They omit to consider what poetry is. Those who think\
Bacon wrote _Hamlet_, and those who think several poets wrote the\
_Iliad_, can make out a deal of ingenious evidence for their doctrines.\
But it is all useless, because the first assumption in each case is\
unthinkable. It is psychologically impossible that the mind of Bacon\
should have produced _Hamlet_; but the impossibility is even more\
clamant when it comes to supposing that several poets, not in\
collaboration, but in haphazard succession, could produce a poem of vast\
sweeping unity and superbly consistent splendour of style. So far as\
mere authorship goes, then, we cannot make any real difference between\
"authentic" and "literary" epic. We cannot say that, while this is\
written by an individual genius, that is the work of a community.\
Individual genius, of whatever quality, is responsible for both. The\
folk, however, cannot be ruled out. Genius does the work; but the folk\
is the condition in which genius does it. And here we may find a genuine\
difference between "literary" and "authentic"; not so much in the nature\
of the condition as in its closeness and insistence.\
\
The kind of folk-spirit behind the poet is, indeed, different in the\
_Iliad_ and _Beowulf_ and the _Song of Roland_ from what it is in Milton\
and Tasso and Virgil. But there is also as much difference here between\
the members of each class as between the two classes themselves. You\
cannot read much of _Beowulf_ with Homer in your mind, without becoming\
conscious that the difference in individual genius is by no means the\
whole difference. Both poets maintain a similar ideal in life; but they\
maintain it within conditions altogether unlike. The folk-spirit behind\
_Beowulf_ is cloudy and tumultuous, finding grandeur in storm and gloom\
and mere mass--in the misty _lack_ of shape. Behind Homer it is, on the\
contrary, radiant and, however vehement, always delighting in measure,\
finding grandeur in brightness and clarity and shining outline. So,\
again, we may very easily see how Tasso's poetry implies the Italy of\
his time, and Milton's the England of his time. But where Homer and\
Beowulf together differ from Tasso and Milton is in the way the\
surrounding folk-spirit contains the poet's mind. It would be a very\
idle piece of work, to choose between the potency of Homer's genius and\
of Milton's; but it is clear that the immediate circumstance of the\
poet's life presses much more insistently on the _Iliad_ and the\
_Odyssey_ than on _Paradise Lost_. It is the difference between the\
contracted, precise, but vigorous tradition of an heroic age, and the\
diffused, eclectic, complicated culture of a civilization. And if it may\
be said that the insistence of racial circumstance in Homer gives him a\
greater intensity of cordial, human inspiration, it must also be said\
that the larger, less exacting conditions of Milton's mental life allow\
his art to go into greater scope and more subtle complexity of\
significance. Great epic poetry will always frankly accept the social\
conditions within which it is composed; but the conditions contract and\
intensify the conduct of the poem, or allow it to dilate and absorb\
larger matter, according as the narrow primitive torrents of man's\
spirit broaden into the greater but slower volume of civilized life. The\
change is neither desirable nor undesirable; it is merely inevitable. It\
means that epic poetry has kept up with the development of human life.\
\
It is because of all this that we have heard a good deal about the\
"authentic" epic getting "closer to its subject" than "literary" epic.\
It seems, on the face of it, very improbable that there should be any\
real difference here. No great poetry, of whatever kind, is conceivable\
unless the subject has become integrated with the poet's mind and mood.\
Milton is as close to his subject, Virgil to his, as Homer to Achilles\
or the Saxon poet to Beowulf. What is really meant can be nothing but\
the greater insistence of racial tradition in the "authentic" epics. The\
subject of the _Iliad_ is the fighting of heroes, with all its\
implications and consequences; the subject of the _Odyssey_ is adventure\
and its opposite, the longing for safety and home; in _Beowulf_ it is\
kingship--the ability to show man how to conquer the monstrous forces of\
his world; and so on. Such were the subjects which an imperious racial\
tradition pressed on the early epic poet, who delighted to be so\
governed. These were the matters which his people could understand, of\
which they could easily perceive the significance. For him, then, there\
could be no other matters than these, or the like of these. But it is\
not in such matters that a poet living in a time of less primitive and\
more expanded consciousness would find the highest importance. For a\
Roman, the chief matter for an epic poem would be Roman civilization;\
for a Puritan, it would be the relations of God and man. When,\
therefore, we consider how close to his subject an epic poet is, we must\
be careful to be quite clear what his subject is. And if he has gone\
beyond the immediate experiences of primitive society, we need not\
expect him to be as close as the early poets were to the fury of battle\
and the agony of wounds and the desolation of widows; or to the\
sensation of exploring beyond the familiar regions; or to the\
marsh-fiends and fire-drakes into which primitive imagination naturally\
translated the terrible unknown powers of the world. We need not, in a\
word, expect the "literary" epic to compete with the "authentic" epic;\
for the fact is, that the purpose of epic poetry, and therefore the\
nature of its subject, must continually develop. It is quite true that\
the later epics take over, to a very great extent, the methods and\
manners of the earlier poems; just as architecture hands on the style of\
wooden structure to an age that builds in stone, and again imposes the\
manners of stone construction on an age that builds in concrete and\
steel. But, in the case of epic at any rate, this is not merely the\
inertia of artistic convention. With the development of epic intention,\
and the subsequent choosing of themes larger and subtler than what\
common experience is wont to deal in, a certain duplicity becomes\
inevitable. The real intention of the _Aeneid_, and the real intention\
of _Paradise Lost_, are not easily brought into vivid apprehension. The\
natural thing to do, then, would be to use the familiar substance of\
early epic, but to use it as a convenient and pleasant solvent for the\
novel intention. It is what has been done in all the great "literary"\
epics. But hasty criticism, finding that where they resembled Homer\
they seemed not so close to their matter, has taken this as a pervading\
and unfortunate characteristic. It has not perceived that what in Homer\
was the main business of the epic, has become in later epic a device.\
Having so altered, it has naturally lost in significance; but in the\
greatest instances of later epic, that for which the device was used has\
been as profoundly absorbed into the poet's being as Homer's matter was\
into his being. It may be noted, too, that a corresponding change has\
also taken place in the opposite direction. As Homer's chief substance\
becomes a device in later epic, so a device of Homer's becomes in later\
epic the chief substance. Homer's supernatural machinery may be reckoned\
as a device--a device to heighten the general style and action of his\
poems; the _significance_ of Homer must be found among his heroes, not\
among his gods. But with Milton, it has become necessary to entrust to\
the supernatural action the whole aim and purport of the poem.\
\
On the whole, then, there is no reason why "literary" epic should not be\
as close to its subject as "authentic" epic; there is every reason why\
both kinds should be equally close. But in testing whether they actually\
are equally close, we have to remember that in the later epic it has\
become necessary to use the ostensible subject as a vehicle for the real\
subject. And who, with any active sympathy for poetry, can say that\
Milton felt his theme with less intensity than Homer? Milton is not so\
close to his fighting angels as Homer is to his fighting men; but the\
war in heaven is an incident in Milton's figurative expression of\
something that has become altogether himself--the mystery of individual\
existence in universal existence, and the accompanying mystery of sin,\
of individual will inexplicably allowed to tamper with the divinely\
universal will. Milton, of course, in closeness to his subject and in\
everything else, stands as supreme above the other poets of literary\
epic as Homer does above the poets of authentic epic. But what is true\
of Milton is true, in less degree, of the others. If there is any good\
in them, it is primarily because they have got very close to their\
subjects: that is required not only for epic, but for all poetry.\
Coleridge, in a famous estimate put twenty years for the shortest period\
in which an epic could be composed; and of this, ten years were to be\
for preparation. He meant that not less than ten years would do for the\
poet to fill all his being with the theme; and nothing else will serve,\
It is well known how Milton brooded over his subject, how Virgil\
lingered over his, how Camoen. carried the _Luisads_ round the world\
with him, with what furious intensity Tasso gave himself to writing\
_Jerusalem Delivered_. We may suppose, perhaps, that the poets of\
"authentic" epic had a somewhat easier task. There was no need for them\
to be "long choosing and beginning late." The pressure of racial\
tradition would see that they chose the right sort of subject; would\
see, too, that they lived right in the heart of their subject. For the\
poet of "literary" epic, however, it is his own consciousness that must\
select the kind of theme which will fulfil the epic intention for his\
own day; it is his own determination and studious endurance that will\
draw the theme into the secrets of his being. If he is not capable of\
getting close to his subject, we should not for that reason call his\
work "literary" epic. It would put him in the class of Milton, the most\
literary of all poets. We must simply call his stuff bad epic. There is\
plenty of it. Southey is the great instance. Southey would decide to\
write an epic about Spain, or India, or Arabia, or America. Next he\
would read up, in several languages, about his proposed subject; that\
would take him perhaps a year. Then he would versify as much strange\
information as he could remember; that might take a few months. The\
result is deadly; and because he was never anywhere near his subject. It\
is for the same reason that the unspeakable labours of Blackmore, Glover\
and Wilkie, and Voltaire's ridiculous _Henriade_, have gone to pile up\
the rubbish-heaps of literature.\
\
So far, supposed differences between "authentic" and "literary" epic\
have resolved themselves into little more than signs of development in\
epic intention; the change has not been found to produce enough artistic\
difference between early and later epic to warrant anything like a\
division into two distinct species. The epic, whether "literary" or\
"authentic," is a single form of art; but it is a form capable of\
adapting itself to the altering requirements of prevalent consciousness.\
In addition, however, to differences in general conception, there are\
certain mechanical differences which should be just noticed. The first\
epics were intended for recitation; the literary epic is meant to be\
read. It is more difficult to keep the attention of hearers than of\
readers. This in itself would be enough to rule out themes remote from\
common experience, supposing any such were to suggest themselves to the\
primitive epic poet. Perhaps, indeed, we should not be far wrong if we\
saw a chief reason for the pressure of surrounding tradition on the\
early epic in this very fact, that it is poetry meant for recitation.\
Traditional matter must be glorified, since it would be easier to listen\
to the re-creation of familiar stories than to quite new and unexpected\
things; the listeners, we must remember, needed poetry chiefly as the\
re-creation of tired hours. Traditional manner would be equally\
difficult to avoid; for it is a tradition that plainly embodies the\
requirements, fixed by experience, of _recited_ poetry. Those features\
of it which make for tedium when it is read--repetition, stock epithets,\
set phrases for given situations--are the very things best suited, with\
their recurring well-known syllables, to fix the attention of listeners\
more firmly, or to stir it when it drowses; at the least they provide a\
sort of recognizable scaffolding for the events, and it is remarkable\
how easily the progress of events may be missed when poetry is\
declaimed. Indeed, if the primitive epic poet could avoid some of the\
anxieties peculiar to the composition of literary epic, he had others to\
make up for it. He had to study closely the delicate science of holding\
auricular attention when once he had got it; and probably he would have\
some difficulty in getting it at all. The really great poet challenges\
it, like Homer, with some tremendous, irresistible opening; and in this\
respect the magnificent prelude to _Beowulf_ may almost be put beside\
Homer. But lesser poets have another way. That prolixity at the\
beginning of many primitive epics, their wordy deliberation in getting\
under way, is probably intentional. The _Song of Roland_, for instance,\
begins with a long series of exceedingly dull stanzas; to a reader, the\
preliminaries of the story seem insufferably drawn out. But by the time\
the reciter had got through this unimportant dreariness, no doubt his\
audience had settled down to listen. The _Chanson d'Antioche_ contains\
perhaps the most illuminating admission of this difficulty. In the first\
"Chant," the first section opens:[4]\
\
  Seigneurs, faites silence; et que tout bruit cesse,\
  Si vous voulez entendre une glorieuse chanson.\
  Aucun jongleur ne vous en dira une meilleure.\
\
Then some vaguely prelusive lines. But the audience is clearly not quite\
ready yet, for the second section begins:\
\
  Barons, \'e9coutez-moi, et cessez vos querelles!\
  Je vous dirai une tr\'e8s-belle chanson.\
\
And after some further prelude, the section ends:\
\
  Ici commence la chanson o\'f9 il y a tant \'e0 apprendre.\
\
The "Chanson" does, indeed, make some show of beginning in the third\
section, but it still moves with a cautious and prelusive air, as if\
anxious not to launch out too soon. And this was evidently prudent, for\
when the fourth section opens, direct exhortation to the audience has\
again become necessary:\
\
  Maintenant, seigneurs, \'e9coutez ce que dit l'\'c9criture.\
\
And once more in the fifth section:\
\
  Barons, \'e9coutez un excellent couplet.\
\
In the sixth, the jongleur is getting desperate:\
\
  Seigneurs, pour l'amour de Dieu, faites silence, \'e9coutez-moi,\
  Pour qu'en partant de ce monde vous entriez dans un meilleur;\
\
but after this exclamation he has his way, though the story proper is\
still a good way off. Perhaps not all of these hortatory stanzas were\
commonly used; any or all of them could certainly be omitted without\
damaging the poem. But they were there to be used, according to the\
judgment of the jongleur and the temper of his audience, and their\
presence in the poem is very suggestive of the special difficulties in\
the art of rhapsodic poetry.\
\
But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry\
meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal\
beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell. Vigorous but controlled\
imagination, formative power, insight into the significance of\
things--these are qualities which a poet must eminently possess; but\
these are qualities which may also be eminently possessed by men who\
cannot claim the title of poet. The real differentia of the poet is his\
command over the secret magic of words. Others may have as delighted a\
sense of this magic, but it is only the poet who can master it and do\
what he likes with it. And next to the invention of speaking itself, the\
most important invention for the poet has been the invention of writing\
and reading; for this has added immensely to the scope of his mastery\
over words. No poet will ever take the written word as a substitute for\
the spoken word; he knows that it is on the spoken word, and the spoken\
word only, that his art is founded. But he trusts his reader to do as he\
himself does--to receive written words always as the code of spoken\
words. To do so has wonderfully enlarged his technical opportunities;\
for apprehension is quicker and finer through the eye than through the\
ear. After the invention of reading, even poetry designed primarily for\
declamation (like drama or lyric) has depths and subtleties of art which\
were not possible for the primitive poet. Accordingly we find that, on\
the whole, in comparison with "literary" epic, the texture of\
"authentic" epic is flat and dull. The story may be superb, and its\
management may be superb; but the words in which the story lives do not\
come near the grandeur of Milton, or the exquisiteness of Virgil, or the\
deliciousness of Tasso. Indeed, if we are to say what is the real\
difference between _Beowulf_ and _Paradise Lost_, we must simply say\
that _Beowulf_ is not such good poetry. There is, of course, one\
tremendous exception; Homer is the one poet of authentic epic who had\
sufficient genius to make unfailingly, nobly beautiful poetry within the\
strict and hard conditions of purely auricular art. Compare Homer's\
ambrosial glory with the descent tap-water of Hesiod; compare his\
continuous burnished gleam of wrought metal with the sparse grains that\
lie in the sandy diction of all the "authentic" epics of the other\
nations. And, by all ancient accounts, the other early Greek epics would\
not fare much better in the comparison. Homer's singularity in this\
respect is overwhelming; but it is frequently forgotten, and especially\
by those who think to help in the Homeric question by comparing him with\
other "authentic" epics. Supposing (we can only just suppose it) a case\
were made out for the growth rather than the individual authorship of\
some "authentic" epic other than Homer; it could never have any bearing\
on the question of Homeric authorship, because no early epic is\
comparable with the _poetry_ of Homer. Nothing, indeed, is comparable\
with the poetry of Homer, except poetry for whose individual authorship\
history unmistakably vouches.\
\
So we cannot say that Homer was not as deliberate a craftsman in words\
as Milton himself. The scope of his craft was more restricted, as his\
repetitions and stock epithets show; he was restricted by the fact that\
he composed for recitation, and the auricular appreciation of diction is\
limited, the nature of poetry obeying, in the main, the nature of those\
for whom it is composed. But this is just a case in which genius\
transcends technical scope. The effects Homer produced with his methods\
were as great as any effects produced by later and more elaborate\
methods, after poetry began to be read as well as heard. But neither\
must we say that the other poets of "authentic" epic were not deliberate\
craftsmen in words. Poets will always get as much beauty out of words as\
they can. The fact that so often in the early epics a magnificent\
subject is told, on the whole, in a lumpish and tedious diction, is not\
to be explained by any contempt for careful art, as though it were a\
thing unworthy of such heroic singers; it is simply to be explained by\
lack of such genius as is capable of transcending the severe limitations\
of auricular poetry. And we may well believe that only the rarest and\
most potent kind of genius could transcend such limitations.\
\
In summary, then, we find certain conceptual differences and certain\
mechanical differences between "authentic" and "literary" epic. But\
these are not such as to enable us to say that there is, artistically,\
any real difference between the two kinds. Rather, the differences\
exhibit the changes we might expect in an art that has kept up with\
consciousness developing, and civilization becoming more intricate.\
"Literary" epic is as close to its subject as "authentic"; but, as a\
general rule, "authentic" epic, in response to its surrounding needs,\
has a simple and concrete subject, and the closeness of the poet to this\
is therefore more obvious than in "literary" epic, which (again in\
response to surrounding needs) has been driven to take for subject some\
great abstract idea and display this in a concrete but only ostensible\
subject. Then in craftsmanship, the two kinds of epic are equally\
deliberate, equally concerned with careful art; but "literary" epic has\
been able to take such advantage of the habit of reading that, with the\
single exception of Homer, it has achieved a diction much more\
answerable to the greatness of epic matter than the "authentic" poems.\
We may, then, in a general survey, regard epic poetry as being in all\
ages essentially the same kind of art, fulfilling always a similar,\
though constantly developing, intention. Whatever sort of society he\
lives in, whether he be surrounded by illiterate heroism or placid\
culture, the epic poet has a definite function to perform. We see him\
accepting, and with his genius transfiguring, the general circumstance\
of his time; we see him symbolizing, in some appropriate form, whatever\
sense of the significance of life he feels acting as the accepted\
unconscious metaphysic of his age. To do this, he takes some great story\
which has been absorbed into the prevailing consciousness of his people.\
As a rule, though not quite invariably, the story will be of things\
which are, or seem, so far back in the past, that anything may credibly\
happen in it; so imagination has its freedom, and so significance is\
displayed. But quite invariably, the materials of the story will have an\
unmistakable air of actuality; that is, they come profoundly out of\
human experience, whether they declare legendary heroism, as in Homer\
and Virgil, or myth, as in _Beowulf_ and _Paradise Lost_, or actual\
history, as in Lucan and Camoens and Tasso. And he sets out this story\
and its significance in poetry as lofty and as elaborate as he can\
compass. That, roughly, is what we see the epic poets doing, whether\
they be "literary" or "authentic"; and if this can be agreed on, we\
should now have come tolerably close to a definition of epic poetry.\

\
THE NATURE OF EPIC\
\
Rigid definitions in literature are, however, dangerous. At bottom, it\
is what we feel, not what we think, that makes us put certain poems\
together and apart from others; and feelings cannot be defined, but only\
related. If we define a poem, we say what we think about it; and that\
may not sufficiently imply the essential thing the poem does for us.\
Hence the definition is liable either to be too strict, or to admit work\
which does not properly satisfy the criterion of feeling. It seems\
probable that, in the last resort, classification in literature rests on\
that least tangible, least definable matter, style; for style is the\
sign of the poem's spirit, and it is the spirit that we feel. If we can\
get some notion of how those poems, which we call epic, agree with one\
another in style, it is likely we shall be as close as may be to a\
definition of epic. I use the word "style," of course, in its largest\
sense--manner of conception as well as manner of composition.\
\
An easy way to define epic, though not a very profitable way, would be\
to say simply, that an epic is a poem which produces feelings similar to\
those produced by _Paradise Lost_ or the _Iliad_, _Beowulf_ or the _Song\
of Roland_. Indeed, you might include all the epics of Europe in this\
definition without losing your breath; for the epic poet is the rarest\
kind of artist. And while it is not a simple matter to say off-hand what\
it is that is common to all these poems, there seems to be general\
acknowledgment that they are clearly separable from other kinds of\
poetry; and this although the word epic has been rather badly abused.\
For instance, _The Faery Queene_ and _La Divina Commedia_ have been\
called epic poems; but I do not think that anyone could fail to admit,\
on a little pressure, that the experience of reading _The Faery Queene_\
or _La Divina Commedia_ is not in the least like the experience of\
reading _Paradise Lost_ or the _Iliad_. But as a poem may have lyrical\
qualities without being a lyric, so a poem may have epical qualities\
without being an epic. In all the poems which the world has agreed to\
call epics, there is a story told, and well told. But Dante's poem\
attempts no story at all, and Spenser's, though it attempts several,\
does not tell them well--it scarcely attempts to make the reader believe\
in them, being much more concerned with the decoration and the\
implication of its fables than with the fables themselves. What epic\
quality, detached from epic proper, do these poems possess, then, apart\
from the mere fact that they take up a great many pages? It is simply a\
question of their style--the style of their conception and the style of\
their writing; the whole style of their imagination, in fact. They take\
us into a region in which nothing happens that is not deeply\
significant; a dominant, noticeably symbolic, purpose presides over each\
poem, moulds it greatly and informs it throughout.\
\
This takes us some little way towards deciding the nature of epic. It\
must be a story, and the story must be told well and greatly; and,\
whether in the story itself or in the telling of it, significance must\
be implied. Does that mean that the epic must be allegorical? Many have\
thought so; even Homer has been accused of constructing allegories. But\
this is only a crude way of emphasizing the significance of epic; and\
there is a vast deal of difference between a significant story and an\
allegorical story. Reality of substance is a thing on which epic poetry\
must always be able to rely. Not only because Spenser does not tell his\
stories very well, but even more because their substance (not, of\
course, their meaning) is deliciously and deliberately unreal, _The\
Faery Queene_ is outside the strict sense of the word epic. Allegory\
requires material ingeniously manipulated and fantastic; what is more\
important, it requires material invented by the poet himself. That is a\
long way from the solid reality of material which epic requires. Not\
manipulation, but imaginative transfiguration of material; not\
invention, but selection of existing material appropriate to his genius,\
and complete absorption of it into his being; that is how the epic poet\
works. Allegory is a beautiful way of inculcating and asserting some\
special significance in life; but epic has a severer task, and a more\
impressive one. It has not to say, Life in the world _ought_ to mean\
this or that; it has to show life unmistakably _being_ significant. It\
does not gloss or interpret the fact of life, but re-creates it and\
charges the fact itself with the poet's own sense of ultimate values.\
This will be less precise than the definite assertions of allegory; but\
for that reason it will be more deeply felt. The values will be\
emotional and spiritual rather than intellectual. And they will be the\
poet's own only because he has made them part of his being; in him\
(though he probably does not know it) they will be representative of the\
best and most characteristic life of his time. That does not mean that\
the epic poet's image of life's significance is of merely contemporary\
or transient importance. No stage through which the general\
consciousness of men has gone can ever be outgrown by men; whatever\
happens afterwards does not displace it, but includes it. We could not\
do without _Paradise Lost_ nowadays; but neither can we do without the\
_Iliad_. It would not, perhaps, be far from the truth, if it were even\
said that the significance of _Paradise Lost_ cannot be properly\
understood unless the significance of the _Iliad_ be understood.\
\
The prime material of the epic poet, then, must be real and not\
invented. But when the story of the poem is safely concerned with some\
reality, he can, of course, graft on this as much appropriate invention\
as he pleases; it will be one of his ways of elaborating his main,\
unifying purpose--and to call it "unifying" is to assume that, however\
brilliant his surrounding invention may be, the purpose will always be\
firmly implicit in the central subject. Some of the early epics manage\
to do without any conspicuous added invention designed to extend what\
the main subject intends; but such nobly simple, forthright narrative as\
_Beowulf_ and the _Song of Roland_ would not do for a purpose slightly\
more subtle than what the makers of these ringing poems had in mind. The\
reality of the central subject is, of course, to be understood broadly.\
It means that the story must be founded deep in the general experience\
of men. A decisive campaign is not, for the epic poet, any more real\
than a legend full of human truth. All that the name of Caesar suggests\
is extremely important for mankind; so is all that the name of Satan\
suggests: Satan, in this sense, is as real as Caesar. And, as far as\
reality is concerned, there is nothing to choose between the Christians\
taking Jerusalem and the Greeks taking Troy; nor between Odysseus\
sailing into fairyland and Vasco da Gama sailing round the world. It is\
certainly possible that a poet might devise a story of such a kind that\
we could easily take it as something which might have been a real human\
experience. But that is not enough for the epic poet. He needs something\
which everyone knows about, something which indisputably, and\
admittedly, _has been_ a human experience; and even Grendel, the fiend\
of the marshes, was, we can clearly see, for the poet of _Beowulf_ a\
figure profoundly and generally accepted as not only true but real;\
what, indeed, can be more real for poetry than a devouring fiend which\
lives in pestilent fens? And the reason why epic poetry so imperiously\
demands reality of subject is clear; it is because such poetry has\
symbolically to re-create the actual fact and the actual particulars of\
human existence in terms of a general significance--the reader must feel\
that life itself has submitted to plastic imagination. No fiction will\
ever have the air, so necessary for this epic symbolism, not merely of\
representing, but of unmistakably _being_, human experience. This might\
suggest that history would be the thing for an epic poet; and so it\
would be, if history were superior to legend in poetic reality. But,\
simply as substance, there is nothing to choose between them; while\
history has the obvious disadvantage of being commonly too strict in the\
manner of its events to allow of creative freedom. Its details will\
probably be so well known, that any modification of them will draw more\
attention to discrepancy with the records than to achievement thereby of\
poetic purpose. And yet modification, or at least suppression and\
exaggeration, of the details of history will certainly be necessary. Not\
to declare what happened, and the results of what happened, is the\
object of an epic; but to accept all this as the mere material in which\
a single artistic purpose, a unique, vital symbolism may be shaped. And\
if legend, after passing for innumerable years through popular\
imagination, still requires to be shaped at the hands of the epic poet,\
how much more must the crude events of history require this! For it is\
not in events as they happen, however notably, that man may see symbols\
of vital destiny, but in events as they are transformed by plastic\
imagination.\
\
Yet it has been possible to use history as the material of great epic\
poetry; Camoens and Tasso did this--the chief subject of the _Lusiads_\
is even contemporary history. But evidently success in these cases was\
due to the exceptional and fortunate fact that the fixed notorieties of\
history were combined with a strange and mysterious geography. The\
remoteness and, one might say, the romantic possibilities of the places\
into which Camoens and Tasso were led by their themes, enable\
imagination to deal pretty freely with history. But in a little more\
than ten years after Camoens glorified Portugal in an historical epic,\
Don Alonso de Ercilla tried to do the same for Spain. He puts his action\
far enough from home: the Spaniards are conquering Chili. But the world\
has grown smaller and more familiar in the interval: the astonishing\
things that could easily happen in the seas of Madagascar cannot now\
conveniently happen in Chili. The _Araucana_ is versified history, not\
epic. That is to say, the action has no deeper significance than any\
other actual warfare; it has not been, and could not have been, shaped\
to any symbolic purpose. Long before Tasso and Camoens and Ercilla, two\
Scotchmen had attempted to put patriotism into epic form; Barbour had\
written his _Bruce_ and Blind Harry his _Wallace_. But what with the\
nearness of their events, and what with the rusticity of their authors,\
these tolerable, ambling poems are quite unable to get the better of the\
hardness of history. Probably the boldest attempt to make epic of\
well-known, documented history is Lucan's _Pharsalia_. It is a brilliant\
performance, and a deliberate effort to carry on the development of\
epic. At the very least it has enriched the thought of humanity with\
some imperishable lines. But it is true, what the great critic said of\
it: the _Pharsalia_ partakes more of the nature of oratory than of\
poetry. It means that Lucan, in choosing history, chose something which\
he had to declaim about, something which, at best, he could\
imaginatively realize; but not something which he could imaginatively\
re-create. It is quite different with poems like the _Song of Roland_.\
They are composed in, or are drawn immediately out of, an heroic age; an\
age, that is to say, when the idea of history has not arisen, when\
anything that happens turns inevitably, and in a surprisingly short\
time, into legend. Thus, an unimportant, probably unpunished, attack by\
Basque mountaineers on the Emperor's rear-guard has become, in the _Song\
of Roland_, a great infamy of Saracenic treachery, which must be greatly\
avenged.\
\
Such, in a broad description, is the nature of epic poetry. To define it\
with any narrower nicety would probably be rash. We have not been\
discovering what an epic poem ought to be, but roughly examining what\
similarity of quality there is in all those poems which we feel,\
strictly attending to the emotional experience of reading them, can be\
classed together and, for convenience, termed epic. But it is not much\
good having a name for this species of poetry if it is given as well to\
poems of quite a different nature. It is not much good agreeing to call\
by the name of epic such poems as the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_,\
_Beowulf_ and the _Song of Roland_, _Paradise Lost_ and _Gerusalemme\
Liberata_, if epic is also to be the title for _The Faery Queene_ and\
_La Divina Commedia_, _The Idylls of the King_ and _The Ring and the\
Book_. But I believe most of the importance in the meaning of the word\
epic, when it is reasonably used, will be found in what is written\
above. Apart from the specific form of epic, it shares much of its\
ultimate intention with the greatest kind of drama (though not with all\
drama). And just as drama, whatever grandeur of purpose it may attempt,\
must be a good play, so epic must be a good story. It will tell its tale\
both largely and intensely, and the diction will be carried on the\
volume of a powerful, flowing metre. To distinguish, however, between\
merely narrative poetry, and poetry which goes beyond being mere\
narrative into the being of epic, must often be left to feeling which\
can scarcely be precisely analysed. A curious instance of the\
difficulty in exactly defining epic (but not in exactly deciding what is\
epic) may be found in the work of William Morris. Morris left two long\
narrative poems, _The Life and Death of Jason_, and _The Story of Sigurd\
the Volsung_.\
\
I do not think anyone need hesitate to put _Sigurd_ among the epics; but\
I do not think anyone who will scrupulously compare the experience of\
reading _Jason_ with the experience of reading _Sigurd_, can help\
agreeing that _Jason_ should be kept out of the epics. There is nothing\
to choose between the subjects of the two poems. For an Englishman,\
Greek mythology means as much as the mythology of the North. And I\
should say that the bright, exact diction and the modest metre of\
_Jason_ are more interesting and attractive than the diction, often\
monotonous and vague, and the metre, often clumsily vehement, of\
_Sigurd_. Yet for all that it is the style of _Sigurd_ that puts it with\
the epics and apart from _Jason_; for style goes beyond metre and\
diction, beyond execution, into conception. The whole imagination of\
_Sigurd_ is incomparably larger than that of _Jason_. In _Sigurd_, you\
feel that the fashioning grasp of imagination has not only seized on the\
show of things, and not only on the physical or moral unity of things,\
but has somehow brought into the midst of all this, and has kneaded into\
the texture of it all, something of the ultimate and metaphysical\
significance of life. You scarcely feel that in _Jason_.\
\
Yes, epic poetry must be an affair of evident largeness. It was well\
said, that "the praise of an epic poem is to feign a person exceeding\
Nature." "Feign" here means to imagine; and imagine does not mean to\
invent. But, like most of the numerous epigrams that have been made\
about epic poetry, the remark does not describe the nature of epic, but\
rather one of the conspicuous signs that that nature is fulfilling\
itself. A poem which is, in some sort, a summation for its time of the\
values of life, will inevitably concern itself with at least one figure,\
and probably with several, in whom the whole virtue, and perhaps also\
the whole failure, of living seems superhumanly concentrated. A story\
weighted with the epic purpose could not proceed at all, unless it were\
expressed in persons big enough to support it. The subject, then, as the\
epic poet uses it, will obviously be an important one. Whether, apart\
from the way the poet uses it, the subject ought to be an important one,\
would not start a very profitable discussion. Homer has been praised for\
making, in the _Iliad_, a first-rate poem out of a second-rate subject.\
It is a neat saying; but it seems unlikely that anything really\
second-rate should turn into first-rate epic. I imagine Homer would have\
been considerably surprised, if anyone had told him that the vast train\
of tragic events caused by the gross and insupportable insult put by\
Agamemnon, the mean mind in authority, on Achilles, the typical\
hero--that this noble and profoundly human theme was a second-rate\
subject. At any rate, the subject must be of capital importance in its\
treatment. It must symbolize--not as a particular and separable\
assertion, but at large and generally--some great aspect of vital\
destiny, without losing the air of recording some accepted reality of\
human experience, and without failing to be a good story; and the\
pressure of high purpose will inform diction and metre, as far, at\
least, as the poet's verbal art will let it.\
\
The usual attempts at stricter definition of epic than anything this\
chapter contains, are either, in spite of what they try for, so vague\
that they would admit almost any long stretch of narrative poetry; or\
else they are based on the accidents or devices of epic art; and in that\
case they are apt to exclude work which is essentially epic because\
something inessential is lacking. It has, for instance, been seriously\
debated, whether an epic should not contain a catalogue of heroes. Other\
things, which epics have been required to contain, besides much that is\
not worth mentioning,[5] are a descent into hell and some supernatural\
machinery. Both of these are obviously devices for enlarging the scope\
of the action. The notion of a visit to the ghosts has fascinated many\
poets, and Dante elaborated this Homeric device into the main scheme of\
the greatest of non-epical poems, as Milton elaborated the other\
Homeric device into the main scheme of the greatest of literary epics.\
But a visit to the ghosts is, of course, like games or single combat or\
a set debate, merely an incident which may or may not be useful.\
Supernatural machinery, however, is worth some short discussion here,\
though it must be alluded to further in the sequel. The first and\
obvious thing to remark is, that an unquestionably epic effect can be\
given without any supernatural machinery at all. The poet of _Beowulf_\
has no need of it, for instance. A Christian redactor has worked over\
the poem, with more piety than skill; he can always be detected, and his\
clumsy little interjections have nothing to do with the general tenour\
of the poem. The human world ends off, as it were, precipitously; and\
beyond there is an endless, impracticable abyss in which dwells the\
secret governance of things, an unknowable and implacable\
fate--"Wyrd"--neither malign nor benevolent, but simply inscrutable. The\
peculiar cast of noble and desolate courage which this bleak conception\
gives to the poem is perhaps unique among the epics.\
\
But very few epic poets have ventured to do without supernatural\
machinery of some sort. And it is plain that it must greatly assist the\
epic purpose to surround the action with immortals who are not only\
interested spectators of the event, but are deeply implicated in it;\
nothing could more certainly liberate, or at least more appropriately\
decorate, the significant force of the subject. We may leave Milton out,\
for there can be no question about _Paradise Lost_ here; the\
significance of the subject is not only liberated by, it entirely exists\
in, the supernatural machinery. But with the other epic poets, we should\
certainly expect them to ask us for our belief in their immortals. That,\
however, is just what they seem curiously careless of doing. The\
immortals are there, they are the occasion of splendid poetry; they do\
what they are intended to do--they declare, namely, by their speech and\
their action, the importance to the world of what is going on in the\
poem. Only--there is no obligation to believe in them; and will not that\
mean, no obligation to believe in their concern for the subject, and all\
that that implies? Homer begins this paradox. Think of that lovely and\
exquisitely mischievous passage in the _Iliad_ called _The Cheating of\
Zeus_. The salvationist school of commentators calls this an\
interpolation; but the spirit of it is implicit throughout the whole of\
Homer's dealing with the gods; whenever, at least, he deals with them at\
length, and not merely incidentally. Not to accept that spirit is not to\
accept Homer. The manner of describing the Olympian family at the end of\
the first book is quite continuous throughout, and simply reaches its\
climax in the fourteenth book. Nobody ever believed in Homer's gods, as\
he must believe in Hektor and Achilles. (Puritans like Xenophanes were\
annoyed not with the gods for being as Homer described them, but with\
Homer for describing them as he did.) Virgil is more decorous; but can\
we imagine Virgil praying, or anybody praying, to the gods of the\
_Aeneid_? The supernatural machinery of Camoens and Tasso is frankly\
absurd; they are not only careless of credibility, but of sanity. Lucan\
tried to do without gods; but his witchcraft engages belief even more\
faintly than the mingled Paganism and Christianity of Camoens, and\
merely shows how strongly the most rationalistic of epic poets felt the\
value of some imaginary relaxation in the limits of human existence. Is\
it, then, only as such a relaxation that supernatural machinery is\
valuable? Or only as a superlative kind of ornament? It is surely more\
than that. In spite of the fact that we are not seriously asked to\
believe in it, it does beautifully and strikingly crystallize the poet's\
determination to show us things that go past the reach of common\
knowledge. But by putting it, whether instinctively or deliberately, on\
a lower plane of credibility than the main action, the poet obeys his\
deepest and gravest necessity: the necessity of keeping his poem\
emphatically an affair of recognizable _human_ events. It is of man, and\
man's purpose in the world, that the epic poet has to sing; not of the\
purpose of gods. The gods must only illustrate man's destiny; and they\
must be kept within the bounds of beautiful illustration. But it\
requires a finer genius than most epic poets have possessed, to keep\
supernatural machinery just sufficiently fanciful without missing its\
function. Perhaps only Homer and Virgil have done that perfectly.\
Milton's revolutionary development marks a crisis in the general process\
of epic so important, that it can only be discussed when that process is\
considered, in the following chapter, as a whole.\

THE EPIC SERIES\
\
By the general process of epic poetry, I mean the way this form of art\
has constantly responded to the profound needs of the society in which\
it was made. But the development of human society does not go straight\
forward; and the epic process will therefore be a recurring process, the\
series a recurring series--though not in exact repetition. Thus, the\
Homeric poems, the _Argonautica_, the _Aeneid_, the _Pharsalia_, and the\
later Latin epics, form one series: the _Aeneid_ would be the climax of\
the series, which thence declines, were it not that the whole originates\
with the incomparable genius of Homer--a fact which makes it seem to\
decline from start to finish. Then the process begins again, and again\
fulfils itself, in the series which goes from _Beowulf_, the _Song of\
Roland_, and the _Nibelungenlied_, through Camoens and Tasso up to\
Milton. And in this case Milton is plainly the climax. There is nothing\
like _Paradise Lost_ in the preceding poems, and epic poetry has done\
nothing since but decline from that towering glory.\
\
But it will be convenient not to make too much of chronology, in a\
general account of epic development. It has already appeared that the\
duties of all "authentic" epic are broadly the same, and the poems of\
this kind, though two thousand years may separate their occurrence, may\
be properly brought together as varieties of one sub-species. "Literary"\
epic differs much more in the specific purpose of its art, as civilized\
societies differ much more than heroic, and also as the looser _milieu_\
of a civilization allows a less strictly traditional exercise of\
personal genius than an heroic age. Still, it does not require any\
manipulation to combine the "literary" epics from both series into a\
single process. Indeed, if we take Homer, Virgil and Milton as the\
outstanding events in the whole progress of epic poetry, and group the\
less important poems appropriately round these three names, we shall not\
be far from the _ideal truth_ of epic development. We might say, then,\
that Homer begins the whole business of epic, imperishably fixes its\
type and, in a way that can never be questioned, declares its artistic\
purpose; Virgil perfects the type; and Milton perfects the purpose.\
Three such poets are not, heaven knows, summed up in a phrase; I mean\
merely to indicate how they are related one to another in the general\
scheme of epic poetry. For discriminating their merits, deciding their\
comparative eminence, I have no inclination; and fortunately it does not\
come within the requirements of this essay. Indeed, I think the reader\
will easily excuse me, if I touch very slightly on the poetic manner, in\
the common and narrow sense, of the poets whom I shall have to mention;\
since these qualities have been so often and sometimes so admirably\
dealt with. It is at the broader aspects of artistic purpose that I wish\
to look.\
\
"From Homer," said Goethe, "I learn every day more clearly, that in our\
life here above ground we have, properly speaking, to enact Hell." It is\
rather a startling sentence at first. That poetry which, for us, in\
Thoreau's excellent words, "lies in the east of literature," scarcely\
suggests, in the usual opinion of it, Hell. We are tempted to think of\
Homer as the most fortunate of poets. It seems as if he had but to open\
his mouth and speak, to create divine poetry; and it does not lessen our\
sense of his good fortune when, on looking a little closer, we see that\
this is really the result of an unerring and unfailing art, an\
extraordinarily skilful technique. He had it entirely at his command;\
and he exercised it in a language in which, though it may be singularly\
artificial and conventional, we can still feel the wonder of its\
sensuous beauty and the splendour of its expressive power. It is a\
language that seems alive with eagerness to respond to imagination. Open\
Homer anywhere, and the casual grandeur of his untranslatable language\
appears; such lines as:\
\
    amphi de naees\
  smerdaleon konabaesan ausanton hup' Achaion.[6]\
\
That, you might say, is Homer at his ease; when he exerts himself you\
get a miracle like:\
\
    su den strophalingi koniaes\
  keiso megas megalosti, lelasmenos hipposunaon.[7]\
\
It seems the art of one who walked through the world of things endowed\
with the senses of a god, and able, with that perfection of effort that\
looks as if it were effortless, to fashion his experience into\
incorruptible song; whether it be the dance of flies round a byre at\
milking-time, or a forest-fire on the mountains at night. The shape and\
clamour of waves breaking on the beach in a storm is as irresistibly\
recorded by Homer as the gleaming flowers which earth put forth to be\
the bed of Zeus and Hera in Gargaros, when a golden cloud was their\
coverlet, and Sleep sat on a pine tree near by in the likeness of a\
murmuring night-jar. It is an art so balanced, that when it tells us,\
with no special emphasis, how the Trojans came on with a din like the\
clangour of a flock of cranes, but the Achaians came on in silence, the\
temper of the two hosts is discriminated for the whole poem; or, in the\
supreme instance, when it tells us how the old men looked at Helen and\
said, "No wonder the young men fight for her!" then Helen's beauty must\
be accepted by the faith of all the world. The particulars of such\
poetry could be enumerated for pages; and this is the poetry which is\
filled, more than any other literature, in the _Iliad_ with the nobility\
of men and women, in the _Odyssey_ with the light of natural magic. And\
think of those gods of Homer's; he is the one poet who has been able to\
make the dark terrors of religion beautiful, harmless and quietly\
entertaining. It is easy to read this poetry and simply _enjoy_ it; it\
is easy to say, the man whose spirit held this poetry must have been\
divinely happy. But this is the poetry whence Goethe learnt that the\
function of man is "to enact Hell."\
\
Goethe is profoundly right; though possibly he puts it in a way to which\
Homer himself might have demurred. For the phrase inevitably has its\
point in the word "Hell"; Homer, we may suppose, would have preferred\
the point to come in the word "enact." In any case, the details of\
Christian eschatology must not engage us much in interpreting Goethe's\
epigram. There is truth in it, not simply because the two poems take\
place in a theatre of calamity; not simply, for instance, because of the\
beloved Hektor's terrible agony of death, and the woes of Andromache and\
Priam. Such things are the partial, incidental expressions of the whole\
artistic purpose. Still less is it because of a strain of latent\
savagery in, at any rate, the _Iliad_; as when the sage and reverend\
Nestor urges that not one of the Greeks should go home until he has lain\
with the wife of a slaughtered Trojan, or as in the tremendous words of\
the oath: "Whoever first offend against this oath, may their brains be\
poured out on the ground like this wine, their own and their children's,\
and may their wives be made subject to strangers." All that is one of\
the accidental qualities of Homer. But the force of the word "enact" in\
Goethe's epigram will certainly come home to us when we think of those\
famous speeches in which courage is unforgettably declared--such\
speeches as that of Sarpedon to Glaukos, or of Glaukos to Diomedes, or\
of Hektor at his parting with Andromache. What these speeches mean,\
however, in the whole artistic purpose of Homer, will assuredly be\
missed if they are _detached_ for consideration; especially we shall\
miss the deep significance of the fact that in all of these speeches the\
substantial thought falls, as it were, into two clauses. Courage is in\
the one clause, a deliberate facing of death; but something equally\
important is in the other. Is it honour? The Homeric hero makes a great\
deal of honour; but it is honour paid to himself, living; what he wants\
above everything is to be admired--"always to be the best"; that is what\
true heroism is. But he is to go where he knows death will strike at\
him; and he does not make much of honour after death; for him, the\
meanest man living is better than a dead hero. Death ends everything, as\
far as he is concerned, honour and all; his courage looks for no reward\
hereafter. No; but _since_ ten thousand fates of death are always\
instant round us; _since_ the generations of men are of no more account\
than leaves of a tree; _since_ Troy and all its people will soon be\
destroyed--he will stand in death's way. Sarpedon emphasizes this with\
its converse: There would be no need of daring and fighting, he says,\
of "man-ennobling battle," if we could be for ever ageless and\
deathless. That is the heroic age; any other would say, If only we could\
not be killed, how pleasant to run what might have been risks! For the\
hero, that would simply not be worth while. Does he find them pleasant,\
then, just because they are risky? Not quite; that, again, is to detach\
part of the meaning from the whole. If anywhere, we shall, perhaps, find\
the whole meaning of Homer most clearly indicated in such words as those\
given (without any enforcement) to Achilles and Thetis near the\
beginning of the _Iliad_, as if to sound the pitch of Homer's poetry:\
\
  m\'eater, hepi m hetekes ge minynthadion per heonta,\
  tim\'ean per moi hophellen Olympios engyalixai\
  Zeus hypsibremet\'eas.[8]\
       *       *       *       *       *\
  tim\'eason moi yion hos h\'f4kymor\'f4tatos hallon\
  heplet'.[9]\
\
Minunthadion--h\'f4kymor\'f4tatos: those are the imporportant words;\
key-words, they might be called. If we really understand these lines, if\
we see in them what it is that Agamemnon's insult has deprived Achilles\
of--the sign and acknowledgment of his fellows' admiration while he is\
still living among them, the one thing which makes a hero's life worth\
living, which enables him to enact his Hell--we shall scarcely complain\
that the _Iliad_ is composed on a second-rate subject. The significance\
of the poem is not in the incidents surrounding the "Achilleis"; the\
whole significance is centred in the Wrath of Achilles, and thence made\
to impregnate every part.\
\
Life is short; we must make the best of it. How trite that sounds! But\
it is not trite at all really. It seems difficult, sometimes, to believe\
that there was a time when sentiments now become habitual, sentiments\
that imply not only the original imperative of conduct, but the original\
metaphysic of living, were by no means altogether habitual. It is\
difficult to imagine backwards into the time when self-consciousness was\
still so fresh from its emergence out of the mere tribal consciousness\
of savagery, that it must not only accept the fact, but first intensely\
_realize_, that man is h\'f4kymor\'f4tatos--a thing of swiftest doom. And it\
was for men who were able, and forced, to do that, that the _Iliad_ and\
the _Odyssey_ and the other early epics were composed. But life is not\
only short; it is, in itself, _valueless_. "As the generation of leaves,\
so is the generation of men." The life of man matters to nobody but\
himself. It happens incidentally in universal destiny; but beyond just\
happening it has no function. No function, of course, except for man\
himself. If man is to find any value in life it is he himself that must\
create the value. For the sense of the ultimate uselessness of life, of\
the blankness of imperturbable darkness that surrounds it, Goethe's word\
"Hell" is not too shocking. But no one has properly lived who has not\
felt this Hell; and we may easily believe that in an heroic age, the\
intensity of this feeling was the secret of the intensity of living. For\
where will the primitive instinct of man, where will the hero, find the\
chance of creating a value for life? In danger, and in the courage that\
welcomes danger. That not only evaluates life; it derives the value from\
the very fact that forces man to create value--the fact of his swift and\
instant doom--h\'f4kymor\'f4tatos once more; it makes this dreadful fact\
_enjoyable_. And so, with courage as the value of life, and man thence\
delightedly accepting whatever can be made of his passage, the doom of\
life is not simply suffered; man enacts his own life; he has mastered\
it.\
\
We need not say that this is the lesson of Homer. And all this, barely\
stated, is a very different matter from what it is when it is poetically\
symbolized in the vast and shapely substance of the _Iliad_ and the\
_Odyssey_. It is quite possible, of course, to appreciate, pleasantly\
and externally, the _Iliad_ with its pressure of thronging life and its\
daring unity, and the _Odyssey_ with its serener life and its superb\
construction, though much more sectional unity. But we do not appreciate\
what Homer did for his time, and is still doing for all the world, we do\
not appreciate the spirit of his music, unless we see the warfare and\
the adventure as symbols of the primary courage of life; and there is\
more in those words than seems when they are baldly written. And it is\
not his morals, but Homer's art that does that for us. And what Homer's\
art does supremely, the other early epics do in their way too. Their way\
is not to be compared with Homer's way. They are very much nearer than\
he is to the mere epic material--to the moderate accomplishment of the\
primitive ballad. Apart from their greatness, and often successful\
greatness, of intention, perhaps the only one that has an answerable\
greatness in the detail of its technique is _Beowulf_. That is not on\
account of its "kennings"--the strange device by which early popular\
poetry (Hesiod is another instance) tries to liberate and master the\
magic of words. A good deal has been made of these "kennings"; but it\
does not take us far towards great poetry, to have the sea called\
"whale-road" or "swan-road" or "gannet's-bath"; though we are getting\
nearer to it when the sun is called "candle of the firmament" or\
"heaven's gem." On the whole, the poem is composed in an elaborate,\
ambitious diction which is not properly governed. Alliteration proves a\
somewhat dangerous principle; it seems mainly responsible for the way\
the poet makes his sentences by piling up clauses, like shooting a load\
of stones out of a cart. You cannot always make out exactly what he\
means; and it is doubtful whether he always had a clearly-thought\
meaning. Most of the subsidiary matter is foisted in with monstrous\
clumsiness. Yet _Beowulf_ has what we do not find, out of Homer, in the\
other early epics. It has occasionally an unforgettable grandeur of\
phrasing. And it has other and perhaps deeper poetic qualities. When the\
warriors are waiting in the haunted hall for the coming of the\
marsh-fiend Grendel, they fall into untroubled sleep; and the poet adds,\
with Homeric restraint: "Not one of them thought that he should thence\
be ever seeking his loved home again, his people or free city, where he\
was nurtured." The opening is magnificent, one of the noblest things\
that have been done in language. There is some wonderful grim landscape\
in the poem; towards the middle there is a great speech on deterioration\
through prosperity, a piece of sustained intensity that reads like an\
Aeschylean chorus; and there is some admirable fighting, especially the\
fight with Grendel in the hall, and with Grendel's mother under the\
waters, while Beowulf's companions anxiously watch the troubled surface\
of the mere. The fact that the action of the poem is chiefly made of\
single combat with supernatural creatures and that there is not tapestry\
figured with radiant gods drawn between the life of men and the ultimate\
darkness, gives a peculiar and notable character to the way Beowulf\
symbolizes the primary courage of life. One would like to think, with\
some enthusiasts, that this great poem, composed in a language totally\
unintelligible to the huge majority of Englishmen--further from English\
than Latin is from Italian--and perhaps not even composed in England,\
certainly not concerned either with England or Englishmen, might\
nevertheless be called an English epic.\
\
But of course the early epics do not, any of them, merely repeat the\
significance of Homer in another form. They might do that, if poetry had\
to inculcate a moral, as some have supposed. But however nicely we may\
analyse it, we shall never find in poetry a significance which is really\
detachable, and expressible in another way. The significance _is_ the\
poetry. What _Beowulf_ or the _Iliad_ or the _Odyssey_ means is simply\
what it is in its whole nature; we can but roughly indicate it. And as\
poetry is never the same, so its significance is never quite the same.\
Courage as the first necessary value of life is most naively and simply\
expressed, perhaps, in the _Poem of the Cid_; but even here the\
expression is, as in all art, unique, and chiefly because it is\
contrived through solidly imagined characters. There is splendid\
characterization, too, in the _Song of Roland_, together with a fine\
sense of poetic form; not fine enough, however, to avoid a prodigious\
deal of conventional gag. The battling is lavish, but always exciting;\
and in, at least, that section which describes how the dying Oliver,\
blinded by weariness and wounds, mistakes Roland for a pagan and feebly\
smites him with his sword, there is real and piercing pathos. But for\
all his sense of character, the poet has very little discretion in his\
admiration of his heroes. Christianity, in these two poems, has less\
effect than one might think. The conspicuous value of life is still the\
original value, courage; but elaboration and refinement of this begin\
to appear, especially in the _Song of Roland_, as passionately conscious\
patriotism and loyalty. The chief contribution of the _Nibelungenlied_\
to the main process of epic poetry is _plot_ in narrative; a\
contribution, that is, to the manner rather than to the content of epic\
symbolism. There is something that can be called plot in Homer; but with\
him, as in all other early epics, it is of no great account compared\
with the straightforward linking of incidents into a direct chain of\
narrative. The story of the _Nibelungenlied_, however, is not a chain\
but a web. Events and the influence of characters are woven closely and\
intricately together into one tragic pattern; and this requires not only\
characterization, but also the adding to the characters of persistent\
and dominant motives.\
\
Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot\
strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of\
life. But life as courage--the turning of the dark, hard condition of\
life into something which can be exulted in--this, which is the deep\
significance of the art of the first epics, is the absolutely necessary\
foundation for any subsequent valuation of life; Man can achieve nothing\
until he has first achieved courage. And this, much more than any\
inheritance of manner, is what makes all the writers of deliberate or\
"literary" epic imply the existence of Homer. If Homer had not done his\
work, they could not have done theirs. But "literary" epics are as\
necessary as Homer. We cannot go on with courage as the solitary\
valuation of life. We must have the foundation, but we must also have\
the superstructure. Speaking comparatively, it may be said that the\
function of Homeric epic has been to create imperishable symbolism for\
the actual courageous consciousness of life, but the duty of "literary"\
epic has been to develop this function, answerably to the development of\
life itself, into symbolism of some conscious _idea_ of life--something\
at once more formalized and more subtilized than the primary virtue of\
courage. The Greeks, however, were too much overshadowed by the\
greatness of Homer to do much towards this. The _Argonautica_, the\
half-hearted epic of Apollonius Rhodius, is the only attempt that need\
concern us. It is not a poem that can be read straight through; it is\
only enjoyable in moments--moments of charming, minute observation, like\
the description of a sunbeam thrown quivering on the wall from a basin\
of water "which has just been poured out," lines not only charming in\
themselves, but finely used as a simile for Medea's agitated heart; or\
moments of romantic fantasy, as when the Argonauts see the eagle flying\
towards Prometheus, and then hear the Titan's agonized cry. But it is\
not in such passages that what Apollonius did for epic abides. A great\
deal of his third book is a real contribution to the main process, to\
epic content as well as to epic manner. To the manner of epic he added\
analytic psychology. No one will ever imagine character more deeply or\
more firmly than Homer did in, say, Achilles; but Apollonius was the man\
who showed how epic as well as drama may use the nice minutiae of\
psychological imagination. Through Virgil, this contribution to epic\
manner has pervaded subsequent literature. Apollonius, too, in his\
fumbling way, as though he did not quite know what he was doing, has yet\
done something very important for the development of epic significance.\
Love has been nothing but a subordinate incident, almost one might say\
an ornament, in the early epics; in Apollonius, though working through a\
deal of gross and lumbering mythological machinery, love becomes for the\
first time one of the primary values of life. The love of Jason and\
Medea is the vital symbolism of the _Argonautica_.\
\
But it is Virgil who really begins the development of epic art. He took\
over from Apollonius love as part of the epic symbolism of life, and\
delicate psychology as part of the epic method. And, like Apollonius, he\
used these novelties chiefly in the person of a heroine. But in Virgil\
they belong to an incomparably greater art; and it is through Virgil\
that they have become necessities of the epic tradition. More than this,\
however, was required of him. The epic poet collaborates with the spirit\
of his time in the composition of his work. That is, if he is\
successful; the time may refuse to work with him, but he may not refuse\
to work with his time. Virgil not only implies, he often clearly states,\
the original epic values of life, the Homeric values; as in the famous:\
\
  Stat sua cuique dies; breve et inreparabile tempus\
  Omnibus est vitae: sed famam extendere factis,\
  Hoc virtutis opus.[10]\
\
But to write a poem chiefly to symbolize this simple, heroic metaphysic\
would scarcely have done for Virgil; it would certainly not have done\
for his time. It was eminently a time of social organization, one might\
perhaps say of social consciousness. After Sylla and Marius and Caesar,\
life as an affair of sheer individualism would not very strongly appeal\
to a thoughtful Roman. Accordingly, as has so often been remarked, the\
_Aeneid_ celebrates the Roman Empire. A political idea does not seem a\
very likely subject for a kind of poetry which must declare greatly the\
fundamentals of living; not even when it is a political idea unequalled\
in the world, the idea of the Roman Empire. Had Virgil been a _good\
Roman_, the _Aeneid_ might have been what no doubt Augustus, and Rome\
generally, desired, a political epic. But Virgil was not a good Roman;\
there was something in him that was not Roman at all. It was this\
strange incalculable element in him that seems for ever making him\
accomplish something he had not thought of; it was surely this that made\
him, unintentionally it may be, use the idea of the Roman Empire as a\
vehicle for a much profounder valuation of life. We must remember here\
the Virgil of the Fourth Eclogue--that extraordinary, impassioned poem\
in which he dreams of man attaining to some perfection of living. It is\
still this Virgil, though saddened and resigned, who writes the\
_Aeneid_. Man creating his own destiny, man, however wearied with the\
long task of resistance, achieving some conscious community of\
aspiration, and dreaming of the perfection of himself: the poet whose\
lovely and noble art makes us a great symbol of _that_, is assuredly\
carrying on the work of Homer. This was the development in epic\
intention required to make epic poetry answer to the widening needs of\
civilization.\
\
But even more important, in the whole process of epic, than what\
Virgil's art does, is the way it does it. And this in spite of the fact\
which everyone has noticed, that Virgil does not compare with Homer as a\
poet of seafaring and warfaring. He is not, indeed, very interested in\
either; and it is unfortunate that, in managing the story of Aeneas (in\
itself an excellent medium for his symbolic purpose) he felt himself\
compelled to try for some likeness to the _Odyssey_ and the _Iliad_--to\
do by art married to study what the poet of the _Odyssey_ and the\
_Iliad_ had done by art married to intuitive experience. But his failure\
in this does not matter much in comparison with his technical success\
otherwise. Virgil showed how poetry may be made deliberately adequate to\
the epic purpose. That does not mean that Virgil is more artistic than\
Homer. Homer's redundance, wholesale repetition of lines, and stock\
epithets cannot be altogether dismissed as "faults"; they are\
characteristics of a wonderfully accomplished and efficient technique.\
But epic poetry cannot be written as Homer composed it; whereas it must\
be written something as Virgil wrote it; yes, if epic poetry is to be\
_written_, Virgil must show how that is to be done. The superb Virgilian\
economy is the thing for an epic poet now; the concision, the\
scrupulousness, the loading of every word with something appreciable of\
the whole significance. After the _Aeneid_, the epic style must be of\
this fashion:\
\
  Ibant ovscuri sola sub nocte per umbram\
  Perque domos Ditis vacuas et inania regna:\
  Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna\
  Est iter in silvis, ubi caelum condidit umbra\
  Jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem.[11]\
\
Lucan is much more of a Roman than Virgil; and the _Pharsalia_, so far\
as it is not an historical epic, is a political one; the idea of\
political liberty is at the bottom of it. That is not an unworthy theme;\
and Lucan evidently felt the necessity for development in epic. But he\
made the mistake, characteristically Roman, of thinking history more\
real than legend; and, trying to lead epic in this direction,\
supernatural machinery would inevitably go too. That, perhaps, was\
fortunate, for it enabled Lucan safely to introduce one of his great and\
memorable lines:\
\
  Jupiter est quodcunque vides, quodcunque moveris;[12]\
\
which would certainly explode any supernatural machinery that could be\
invented. The _Pharsalia_ could not be anything more than an interesting\
but unsuccessful attempt; it was not on these lines that epic poetry was\
to develop. Lucan died at an age when most poets have done nothing very\
remarkable; that he already had achieved a poem like the _Pharsalia_,\
would make us think he might have gone to incredible heights, were it\
not that the mistake of the _Pharsalia_ seems to belong incurably to his\
temperament.\
\
Lucan's determined stoicism may, philosophically, be more consistent\
than the dubious stoicism of Virgil. But Virgil knew that, in epic,\
supernatural imagination is better than consistency. It was an important\
step when he made Jupiter, though a personal god, a power to which no\
limits are assigned; when he also made the other divinities but shadows,\
or, at most, functions, of Jupiter. This answers to his conviction that\
spirit universally and singly pervades matter; but, what is more, it\
answers to the needs of epic development. When we come to Tasso and\
Camoens, we seem to have gone backward in this respect; we seem to come\
upon poetry in which supernatural machinery is in a state of chronic\
insubordination. But that, too, was perhaps necessary. In comparison\
with the _Aeneid, Gerusalemme Liberata_ and _Os Lusiadas_ lack\
intellectual control and spiritual depth; but in comparison with the\
Roman, the two modern poems thrill with a new passion of life, a new\
wine of life, heady, as it seems, with new significance--a significance\
as yet only felt, not understood. Both Tasso and Camoens clearly join on\
to the main epic tradition: Tasso derives chiefly from the _Aeneid_ and\
the _Iliad_, Camoens from the _Aeneid_ and the _Odyssey_. Tasso is\
perhaps more Virgilian than Camoens; the plastic power of his\
imagination is more assured. But the advantage Camoens has over Tasso\
seems to repeat the advantage Homer has over Virgil; the ostensible\
subject of the _Lusiads_ glows with the truth of experience. But the\
real subject is behind these splendid voyagings, just as the real\
subject of Tasso is behind the battles of Christian and Saracen; and in\
both poets the inmost theme is broadly the same. It is the consciousness\
of modern Europe. _Jerusalem Delivered_ and the _Lusiads_ are drenched\
with the spirit of the Renaissance; and that is chiefly responsible for\
their lovely poetry. But they reach out towards the new Europe that was\
then just beginning. Europe making common cause against the peoples that\
are not Europe; Europe carrying her domination round the world--is that\
what Tasso and Camoens ultimately mean? It would be too hard and too\
narrow a matter by itself to make these poems what they are. No; it is\
not the action of Europe, but the spirit of European consciousness, that\
gave Tasso and Camoens their deepest inspiration. But what European\
consciousness really is, these poets rather vaguely suggest than master\
into clear and irresistible expression, into the supreme symbolism of\
perfectly adequate art. They still took European consciousness as an\
affair of geography and race rather than simply as a triumphant stage in\
the general progress of man's knowledge of himself. Their time imposed a\
duty on them; that they clearly understood. But they did not clearly\
understand what the duty was; partly, no doubt, because they were both\
strongly influenced by mediaeval religion. And so it is atmosphere, in\
Tasso and Camoens, that counts much more than substance; both poets seem\
perpetually thrilled by something they cannot express--the _non so che_\
of Tasso. And what chiefly gives this sense of quivering, uncertain\
significance to their poetry is the increase of freedom and decrease of\
control in the supernatural. Supernaturalism was emphasized, because\
they instinctively felt that this was the means epic poetry must use to\
accomplish its new duties; it was disorderly, because they did not quite\
know what use these duties required. Tasso and Camoens, for all the\
splendour and loveliness of their work, leave epic poetry, as it were,\
consciously dissatisfied--knowing that its future must achieve some\
significance larger and deeper than anything it had yet done, and\
knowing that this must be done somehow through imagined supernaturalism.\
It waited nearly a hundred years for the poet who understood exactly\
what was to be done and exactly how to do it.\
\
In _Paradise Lost_, the development of epic poetry culminates, as far as\
it has yet gone. The essential inspiration of the poem implies a\
particular sense of human existence which has not yet definitely\
appeared in the epic series, but which the process of life in Europe\
made it absolutely necessary that epic poetry should symbolize. In\
Milton, the poet arose who was supremely adequate to the greatest task\
laid on epic poetry since its beginning with Homer; Milton's task was\
perhaps even more exacting than that original one. "His work is not the\
greatest of heroic poems, only because it is not the first." The epigram\
might just as reasonably have been the other way round. But nothing\
would be more unprofitable than a discussion in which Homer and Milton\
compete for supremacy of genius. Our business here is quite otherwise.\
\
With the partial exception of Tasso and Camoens, all epic poetry before\
Milton is some symbolism of man's sense of his own will. It is simply\
this in Homer; and the succeeding poets developed this intention but\
remained well within it. Not even Virgil, with his metaphysic of\
individual merged into social will--not even Virgil went outside it. In\
fact, it is a sort of _monism_ of consciousness that inspires all\
pre-Miltonic epic. But in Milton, it has become a _dualism_. Before him,\
the primary impulse of epic is an impassioned sense of man's nature\
_being contained_--by his destiny: _his_ only because he is in it and\
belongs to it, as we say "_my_ country." With Milton, this has\
necessarily become not only a sense of man's rigorously contained\
nature, but equally a sense of that which contains man--in fact,\
simultaneously a sense of individual will and of universal necessity.\
The single sense of these two irreconcilables is what Milton's poetry\
has to symbolize. Could they be reconciled, the two elements in man's\
modern consciousness of existence would form a monism. But this\
consciousness is a dualism; its elements are absolutely opposed.\
_Paradise Lost_ is inspired by intense consciousness of the eternal\
contradiction between the general, unlimited, irresistible will of\
universal destiny, and defined individual will existing within this, and\
inexplicably capable of acting on it, even against it. Or, if that seems\
too much of an antinomy to some philosophies (and it is perhaps possible\
to make it look more apparent than real), the dualism can be unavoidably\
declared by putting it entirely in terms of consciousness: destiny\
creating within itself an existence which stands against and apart from\
destiny by being _conscious_ of it. In Milton's poetry the spirit of man\
is equally conscious of its own limited reality and of the unlimited\
reality of that which contains him and drives him with its motion--of\
his own will striving in the midst of destiny: destiny irresistible, yet\
his will unmastered.\
\
This is not to examine the development of epic poetry by looking at that\
which is not _poetry_. In this kind of art, more perhaps than in any\
other, we must ignore the wilful theories of those who would set\
boundaries to the meaning of the word poetry. In such a poem as\
Milton's, whatever is in it is its poetry; the poetry of _Paradise Lost_\
is just--_Paradise Lost_! Its pomp of divine syllables and glorious\
images is no more the poetry of Milton than the idea of man which he\
expressed. But the general manner of an art is for ever similar; it is\
its inspiration that is for ever changing. We need never expect words\
and metre to do more than they do here:\
\
          they, fondly thinking to allay\
  Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit\
  Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste\
  With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,\
  Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,\
  With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,\
  With soot and cinders filled;\
\
or more than they do here:\
\
    What though the field be lost?\
  All is not lost; the unconquerable will,\
  And study of revenge, immortal hate,\
  And courage never to submit or yield,\
  And what is else not to be overcome.\
\
But what Homer's words, and perhaps what Virgil's words, set out to do,\
they do just as marvellously. There is no sure way of comparison here.\
How words do their work in poetry, and how we appreciate the way they do\
it--this seems to involve the obscurest processes of the mind: analysis\
can but fumble at it. But we can compare inspiration--the nature of the\
inmost urgent motive of poetry. And it is not irrelevant to add (it\
seems to me mere fact), that Milton had the greatest motive that has\
ever ruled a poet.\
\
For the vehicle of this motive, a fable of purely human action would\
obviously not suffice. What Milton has to express is, of course,\
altogether human; destiny is an entirely human conception. But he has to\
express not simply the sense of human existence occurring in destiny;\
that brings in destiny only mediately, through that which is destined.\
He has to express the sense of destiny immediately, at the same time as\
he expresses its opponent, the destined will of man. Destiny will appear\
in poetry as an omnipotent God; Virgil had already prepared poetry for\
that. But the action at large must clearly consist now, and for the\
first time, overwhelmingly of supernatural imagination. Milton has been\
foolishly blamed for making his supernaturalism too human. But nothing\
can come into poetry that is not shaped and recognizable; how else but\
in anthropomorphism could destiny, or (its poetic equivalent) deity,\
exist in _Paradise Lost_?\
\
We may see what a change has come over epic poetry, if we compare this\
supernatural imagination of Milton's with the supernatural machinery of\
any previous epic poet. Virgil is the most scrupulous in this respect;\
and towards the inevitable change, which Milton completed and perfected\
from Camoens and Tasso, Virgil took a great step in making Jupiter\
professedly almighty. But compare Virgil's "Tantaene animis celestibus\
irae?" with Milton's "Evil, be thou my good!" It is the difference\
between an accidental device and essential substance. That, in order to\
symbolize in epic form--that is to say, in _narrative_ form--the\
dualistic sense of destiny and the destined, and both immediately\
--Milton had to dissolve his human action completely in a\
supernatural action, is the sign not merely of a development, but of a\
re-creation, of epic art.\
\
It has been said that Satan is the hero of _Paradise Lost_. The offence\
which the remark has caused is due, no doubt, to injudicious use of the\
word "hero." It is surely the simple fact that if _Paradise Lost_ exists\
for any one figure, that is Satan; just as the _Iliad_ exists for\
Achilles, and the _Odyssey_ for Odysseus. It is in the figure of Satan\
that the imperishable significance of _Paradise Lost_ is centred; his\
vast unyielding agony symbolizes the profound antinomy of modern\
consciousness. And if this is what he is in significance it is worth\
noting what he is in technique. He is the blending of the poem's human\
plane with its supernatural plane. The epic hero has always represented\
humanity by being superhuman; in Satan he has grown into the\
supernatural. He does not thereby cease to symbolize human existence;\
but he is thereby able to symbolize simultaneously the sense of its\
irreconcilable condition, of the universal destiny that contains it. Out\
of Satan's colossal figure, the single urgency of inspiration, which\
this dualistic consciousness of existence makes, radiates through all\
the regions of Milton's vast and rigorous imagination. "Milton," says\
Landor, "even Milton rankt with living men!"\

AFTER MILTON\
\
And after Milton, what is to happen? First, briefly, for a few instances\
of what has happened. We may leave out experiments in religious\
sentiment like Klopstock's _Messiah_. We must leave out also poems which\
have something of the look of epic at first glance, but have nothing of\
the scope of epic intention; such as Scott's longer poems. These might\
resemble the "lays" out of which some people imagine "authentic" epic to\
have been made. But the lays are not the epic. Scott's poems have not\
the depth nor the definiteness of symbolic intention--what is sometimes\
called the epic unity--and this is what we can always discover in any\
poetry which gives us the peculiar experience we must associate with the\
word epic, if it is to have any precision of meaning. What applies to\
Scott, will apply still more to Byron's poems; Byron is one of the\
greatest of modern poets, but that does not make him an epic poet. We\
must keep our minds on epic intention. Shelley's _Revolt of Islam_ has\
something of it, but too vaguely and too fantastically; the generality\
of human experience had little to do with this glittering poem. Keats's\
_Hyperion_ is wonderful; but it does not go far enough to let us form\
any judgment of it appropriate to the present purpose.[13] Our search\
will not take us far before we notice something very remarkable; poems\
which look superficially like epic turn out to have scarce anything of\
real epic intention; whereas epic intention is apt to appear in poems\
that do not look like epic at all. In fact, it seems as if epic manner\
and epic content were trying for a divorce. If this be so, the\
traditional epic manner will scarcely survive the separation. Epic\
content, however, may very well be looking out for a match with a new\
manner; though so far it does not seem to have found an altogether\
satisfactory partner.\
\
But there are one or two poems in which the old union seems still happy.\
Most noteworthy is Goethe's _Hermann und Dorothea_. You may say that it\
does not much matter whether such poetry should be called epic or, as\
some hold, idyllic. But it is interesting to note, first, that the poem\
is deliberately written with epic style and epic intention; and, second,\
that, though singularly beautiful, it makes no attempt to add anything\
to epic development. It is interesting, too, to see epic poetry trying\
to get away from its heroes, and trying to use material the poetic\
importance of which seems to depend solely on the treatment, not on\
itself. This was a natural and, for some things, a laudable reaction.\
But it inevitably meant that epic must renounce the triumphs which\
Milton had won for it. William Morris saw no reason for abandoning\
either the heroes or anything else of the epic tradition. The chief\
personages of _Sigurd the Volsung_ are admittedly more than human, the\
events frankly marvellous. The poem is an impressive one, and in one way\
or another fulfils all the main qualifications of epic. But perhaps no\
great poem ever had so many faults. These have nothing to do with its\
management of supernaturalism; those who object to this simply show\
ignorance of the fundamental necessities of epic poetry. The first book\
is magnificent; everything that epic narrative should be; but after this\
the poem grows long-winded, and that is the last thing epic poetry\
should be. It is written with a running pen; so long as the verse keeps\
going on, Morris seems satisfied, though it is very often going on\
about unimportant things, and in an uninteresting manner. After the\
first book, indeed, as far as Morris's epic manner is concerned, Virgil\
and Milton might never have lived. It attempts to be the grand manner by\
means of vagueness. In an altogether extraordinary way, the poem slurs\
over the crucial incidents (as in the inept lines describing the death\
of Fafnir, and those, equally hollow, describing the death of\
Guttorm--two noble opportunities simply not perceived) and tirelessly\
expatiates on the mere surroundings of the story. Yet there is no\
attempt to make anything there credible: Morris seems to have mixed up\
the effects of epic with the effects of a fairy-tale. The poem lacks\
intellect; it has no clear-cut thought. And it lacks sensuous images; it\
is full of the sentiment, not of the sense of things, which is the wrong\
way round. Hence the protracted conversations are as a rule amazingly\
windy and pointless, as the protracted descriptions are amazingly\
useless and tedious. And the superhuman virtues of the characters are\
not shown in the poem so much as energetically asserted. It says much\
for the genius of Morris that _Sigurd the Volsung_, with all these\
faults, is not to be condemned; that, on the contrary, to read it is\
rather a great than a tiresome experience; and not only because the\
faults are relieved, here and there, by exquisite beauties and\
dignities, indeed by incomparable lines, but because the poem as a whole\
does, as it goes on, accumulate an immense pressure of significance. All\
the great epics of the world have, however, perfectly clearly a\
significance in close relation with the spirit of their time; the\
intense desire to symbolize the consciousness of man as far as it has\
attained, is what vitally inspires an epic poet, and the ardour of this\
infects his whole style. Morris, in this sense, was not vitally\
inspired. _Sigurd the Volsung_ is a kind of set exercise in epic poetry.\
It is great, but it is not _needed_. It is, in fact, an attempt to write\
epic poetry as it might have been written, and to make epic poetry mean\
what it might have meant, in the days when the tale of Sigurd and the\
Niblungs was newly come among men's minds. Mr. Doughty, in his\
surprising poem _The Dawn in Britain_, also seems trying to compose an\
epic exercise, rather than to be obeying a vital necessity of\
inspiration. For all that, it is a great poem, full of irresistible\
vision and memorable diction. But it is written in a revolutionary\
syntax, which, like most revolutions of this kind, achieves nothing\
beyond the fact of being revolutionary; and Mr. Doughty often uses the\
unexpected effects of his queer syntax instead of the unexpected effects\
of poetry, which makes the poem even longer psychologically than it is\
physically. Lander's _Gebir_ has much that can truly be called epic in\
it; and it has learned the lessons in manner which Virgil and Milton so\
nobly taught. It has perhaps learned them too well; never were\
concision, and the loading of each word with heavy duties, so thoroughly\
practised. The action is so compressed that it is difficult to make out\
exactly what is going on; we no sooner realize that an incident has\
begun than we find ourselves in the midst of another. Apart from these\
idiosyncrasies, the poetry of _Gebir_ is a curious mixture of splendour\
and commonplace. If fiction could ever be wholly, and not only\
partially, epic, it would be in _Gebir_.\
\
In all these poems, we see an epic intention still combined with a\
recognizably epic manner. But what is quite evident is, that in all of\
them there is no attempt to carry on the development of epic, to take up\
its symbolic power where Milton left it. On the contrary, this seems to\
be deliberately avoided. For any tentative advance on Miltonic\
significance, even for any real acceptance of it, we must go to poetry\
which tries to put epic intention into a new form. Some obvious\
peculiarities of epic style are sufficiently definite to be detachable.\
Since Theocritus, a perverse kind of pleasure has often been obtained by\
putting some of the peculiarities of epic--peculiarities really required\
by a very long poem--into the compass of a very short poem. An epic\
idyll cannot, of course, contain any considerable epic intention; it is\
wrought out of the mere shell of epic, and avoids any semblance of epic\
scope. But by devising somehow a connected sequence of idylls, something\
of epic scope can be acquired again. As Hugo says, in his preface to _La\
Legende des Si\'e8cles_: "Comme dans une mosa\'efque, chaque pierre a sa\
couleur et sa forme propre; l'ensemble donne une figure. La figure de ce\
livre," he goes on, "c'est l'homme." To get an epic design or _figure_\
through a sequence of small idylls need not be the result of mere\
technical curiosity. It may be a valuable method for the future of epic.\
Tennyson attempted this method in _Idylls of the King_; not, as is now\
usually admitted, with any great success. The sequence is admirable for\
sheer craftsmanship, for astonishing craftsmanship; but it did not\
manage to effect anything like a conspicuous symbolism. You have but to\
think of _Paradise Lost_ to see what _Idylls of the King_ lacks. Victor\
Hugo, however, did better in _La Legende des Si\'e8cles_. "La figure, c'est\
l'homme"; there, at any rate, is the intention of epic symbolism. And,\
however pretentious the poem may be, it undoubtedly does make a\
passionate effort to develop the significance which Milton had achieved;\
chiefly to enlarge the scope of this significance.[14] Browning's _The\
Ring and the Book_ also uses this notion of an idyllic sequence; but\
without any semblance of epic purpose, purely for the exhibition of\
human character.\
\
It has already been remarked that the ultimate significance of great\
drama is the same as that of epic. Since the vital epic purpose--the\
kind of epic purpose which answers to the spirit of the time--is\
evidently looking for some new form to inhabit, it is not surprising,\
then, that it should have occasionally tried on dramatic form. And,\
unquestionably, for great poetic symbolism of the depths of modern\
consciousness, for such symbolism as Milton's, we must go to two such\
invasions of epic purpose into dramatic manner--to Goethe's _Faust_ and\
Hardy's _The Dynasts_. But dramatic significance and epic significance\
have been admitted to be broadly the same; to take but one instance,\
Aeschylus's Prometheus is closely related to Milton's Satan (though I\
think Prometheus really represents a monism of consciousness--that which\
is destined--as Satan represents a dualism--at once the destined and the\
destiny). How then can we speak of epic purpose invading drama? Surely\
in this way. Drama seeks to present its significance with narrowed\
intensity, but epic in a large dilatation: the one contracts, the other\
expatiates. When, therefore, we find drama setting out its significance\
in such a way as to become epically dilated, we may say that dramatic\
has grown into epic purpose. Or, even more positively, we may say that\
epic has taken over drama and adapted it to its peculiar needs. In any\
case, with one exception to be mentioned presently, it is only in\
_Faust_ and _The Dynasts_ that we find any great development of Miltonic\
significance. These are the poems that give us immense and shapely\
symbols of the spirit of man, conscious not only of the sense of his\
own destined being, but also of some sense of that which destines. In\
fact, these two are the poems that develop and elaborate, in their own\
way, the Miltonic significance, as all the epics in between Homer and\
Milton develop and elaborate Homeric significance. And yet, in spite of\
_Faust_ and _The Dynasts_, it may be doubted whether the union of epic\
and drama is likely to be permanent. The peculiar effects which epic\
intention, in whatever manner, must aim at, seem to be as much hindered\
as helped by dramatic form; and possibly it is because the detail is\
necessarily too much enforced for the broad perfection of epic effect.\
\
The real truth seems to be, that there is an inevitable and profound\
difficulty in carrying on the Miltonic significance in anything like a\
story. Regular epic having reached its climax in _Paradise Lost_, the\
epic purpose must find some other way of going on. Hugo saw this, when\
he strung his huge epic sequence together not on a connected story but\
on a single idea: "la figure, c'est l'homme." If we are to have, as we\
must have, direct symbolism of the way man is conscious of his being\
nowadays, which means direct symbolism both of man's spirit and of the\
(philosophical) opponent of this, the universal fate of things--if we\
are to have all this, it is hard to see how any story can be adequate to\
such symbolic requirements, unless it is a story which moves in some\
large region of imagined supernaturalism. And it seems questionable\
whether we have enough _formal_ "belief" nowadays to allow of such a\
story appearing as solid and as vividly credible as epic poetry needs.\
It is a decided disadvantage, from the purely epic point of view, that\
those admirable "Intelligences" in Hardy's _The Dynasts_ are so\
obviously abstract ideas disguised. The supernaturalism of epic, however\
incredible it may be in the poem, must be worked up out of the material\
of some generally accepted belief. I think it would be agreed, that what\
was possible for Milton would scarcely be possible to-day; and even more\
impossible would be the na\'efvet\'e9 of Homer and the quite different but\
equally impracticable na\'efvet\'e9 of Tasso and Camoens. The conclusion seems\
to be, that the epic purpose will have to abandon the necessity of\
telling a story.\
\
Hugo's way may prove to be the right one. But there may be another; and\
what has happened in the past may suggest what may happen in the future.\
Epic poetry in the regular epic form has before now seemed unlikely. It\
seemed unlikely after the Alexandrians had made such poor attempts at\
standing upright under the immensity of Homer; it seemed so, until,\
after several efforts, Latin poetry became triumphantly epic in Virgil.\
And again, when the mystical prestige of Virgil was domineering\
everything, regular epic seemed unlikely; until, after the doubtful\
attempts of Boiardo and Ariosto, Tasso arrived. But in each case, while\
the occurrence of regular epic was seeming so improbable, it\
nevertheless happened that poetry was written which was certainly\
nothing like epic in form, but which was strongly charged with a\
profound pressure of purpose closely akin to epic purpose; and _De Rerum\
Natura_ and _La Divina Commedia_ are very suggestive to speculation now.\
Of course, the fact that, in both these cases, regular epic did\
eventually occur, must warn us that in artistic development anything may\
happen; but it does seem as if there were a deeper improbability for\
the occurrence of regular epic now than in the times just before Virgil\
and Tasso--of regular epic, that is, inspired by some vital import, not\
simply, like _Sigurd the Volsung_, by archaeological import. Lucretius is\
a good deal more suggestive than Dante; for Dante's form is too exactly\
suited to his own peculiar genius and his own peculiar time to be\
adaptable. But the method of Lucretius is eminently adaptable. That\
amazing image of the sublime mind of Lucretius is exactly the kind of\
lofty symbolism that the continuation of epic purpose now seems to\
require--a subjective symbolism. I believe Wordsworth felt this, when he\
planned his great symbolic poem, and partly executed it in _The Prelude_\
and _The Excursion_: for there, more profoundly than anywhere out of\
Milton himself, Milton's spiritual legacy is employed. It may be, then,\
that Lucretius and Wordsworth will preside over the change from\
objective to subjective symbolism which Milton has, perhaps, made\
necessary for the continued development of the epic purpose: after\
Milton, it seems likely that there is nothing more to be done with\
objective epic. But Hugo's method, of a connected sequence of separate\
poems, instead of one continuous poem, may come in here. The\
determination to keep up a continuous form brought both Lucretius and\
Wordsworth at times perilously near to the odious state of didactic\
poetry; it was at least responsible for some tedium. Epic poetry will\
certainly never be didactic. What we may imagine--who knows how vainly\
imagine?--is, then, a sequence of odes expressing, in the image of some\
fortunate and lofty mind, as much of the spiritual significance which\
the epic purpose must continue from Milton, as is possible, in the style\
of Lucretius and Wordsworth, for subjective symbolism. A pregnant\
experiment towards something like this has already been seen--in George\
Meredith's magnificent set of _Odes in Contribution to the Song of the\
French History_. The subject is ostensibly concrete; but France in her\
agonies and triumphs has been personified into a superb symbol of\
Meredith's own reading of human fate. The series builds up a decidedly\
epic significance, and its manner is extraordinarily suggestive of a new\
epic method. Nevertheless, something more Lucretian in central\
imagination, something less bound to concrete and particular event,\
seems required for the complete development of epic purpose.\

FOOTNOTES:\
\
[Footnote 13: In the greatest poetry, all the elements of human nature\
are burning in a single flame. The artifice of criticism is to detect\
what peculiar radiance each element contributes to the whole light; but\
this no more affects the singleness of the compounded energy in poetry\
than the spectroscopic examination of fire affects the single nature of\
actual flame. For the purposes of this book, it has been necessary to\
look chiefly at the contribution of intellect to epic poetry; for it is\
in that contribution that the development of poetry, so far as there is\
any development at all, really consists. This being so, it might be\
thought that Keats could hardly have done anything for the real progress\
of epic. But Keats's apparent (it is only apparent) rejection of\
intellect in his poetry was the result of youthful theory; his letters\
show that, in fact, intellect was a thing unusually vigorous in his\
nature. If the Keats of the letters be added to the Keats of the poems,\
a personality appears that seems more likely than any of his\
contemporaries, or than anyone who has come after him, for the work of\
carrying Miltonic epic forward without forsaking Miltonic form.]\
\
[Footnote 14: For all I know, Hugo may never have read Milton; judging\
by some silly remarks of his, I should hope not. But Hugo could feel the\
things in the spirit of man that Milton felt; not only because they were\
still there, but because the secret influence of Milton has intensified\
the consciousness of them in thousands who think they know nothing of\
_Paradise Lost_. Modern literary history will not be properly understood\
until it is realized that Milton is one of the dominating minds of\
Europe, whether Europe know it or not. There are scarcely half a dozen\
figures that can be compared with Milton for irresistible\
influence--quite apart from his unapproachable supremacy in the\
technique of poetry. When Addison remarked that _Paradise Lost_ is\
universally and perpetually interesting, he said what is not to be\
questioned; though he did not perceive the real reason for his\
assertion. Darwin no more injured the significance of _Paradise Lost_\
than air-planes have injured Homer.]\

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\

\
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit https://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card\
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\
\
\
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.\
\
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\
new filenames and etext numbers.\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\
\
     https://www.gutenberg.org\
\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
\
EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just\
download by the etext year.\
\
     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\
\
    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\
\
EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\
\
     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\
\
or filename 24689 would be found at:\

THE PREFACE\
\
\
The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and\
conceal the artist is art\'92s aim. The critic is he who can translate\
into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\
things.\
\
The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\
being charming. This is a fault.\
\
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\
cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\
beautiful things mean only beauty.\
\
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\
written, or badly written. That is all.\
\
The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\
his own face in a glass.\
\
The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\
not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\
the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\
the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\
anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\
ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\
mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\
everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\
art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\
point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\
musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor\'92s craft is the\
type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\
surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\
peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\
complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\
himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\
does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\
one admires it intensely.\
\
All art is quite useless.\
\

\
CHAPTER I.\
\
\
The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\
summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\
the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\
perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\
\
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\
lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\
bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\
the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\
those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\
swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\
way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\
insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\
seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\
was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\
\
In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\
full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\
and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\
himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\
caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\
strange conjectures.\
\
As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\
skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\
face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\
closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\
to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\
might awake.\
\
\'93It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\'94 said\
Lord Henry languidly. \'93You must certainly send it next year to the\
Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\
gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\
able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\
I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\
is really the only place.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t think I shall send it anywhere,\'94 he answered, tossing his head\
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\
Oxford. \'93No, I won\'92t send it anywhere.\'94\
\
Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\
the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\
from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. \'93Not send it anywhere? My dear\
fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\
do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\
you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\
only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\
not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\
all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\
old men are ever capable of any emotion.\'94\
\
\'93I know you will laugh at me,\'94 he replied, \'93but I really can\'92t exhibit\
it. I have put too much of myself into it.\'94\
\
Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\
\
\'93Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.\'94\
\
\'93Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn\'92t know you\
were so vain; and I really can\'92t see any resemblance between you, with\
your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\
Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\
my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you\'97well, of course you have an\
intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\
where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\
of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\
sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\
horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\
How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\
then in the Church they don\'92t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\
age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\
and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\
Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\
whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\
that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\
in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\
when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don\'92t flatter\
yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t understand me, Harry,\'94 answered the artist. \'93Of course I am\
not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\
look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\
There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\
the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\
steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one\'92s fellows.\
The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\
at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\
they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\
should live\'97undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\
neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\
Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are\'97my art,\
whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray\'92s good looks\'97we shall all suffer\
for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\'94\
\
\'93Dorian Gray? Is that his name?\'94 asked Lord Henry, walking across the\
studio towards Basil Hallward.\
\
\'93Yes, that is his name. I didn\'92t intend to tell it to you.\'94\
\
\'93But why not?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I can\'92t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\
names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\
to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\
mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\
one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\
am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\
I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\
one\'92s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?\'94\
\
\'93Not at all,\'94 answered Lord Henry, \'93not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\
to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\
makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\
never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\
When we meet\'97we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\
down to the Duke\'92s\'97we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\
most serious faces. My wife is very good at it\'97much better, in fact,\
than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\
when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\
she would; but she merely laughs at me.\'94\
\
\'93I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,\'94 said Basil\
Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. \'93I\
believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\
thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\
fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\
Your cynicism is simply a pose.\'94\
\
\'93Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,\'94\
cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\
polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\
\
After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. \'93I am afraid I must be\
going, Basil,\'94 he murmured, \'93and before I go, I insist on your\
answering a question I put to you some time ago.\'94\
\
\'93What is that?\'94 said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\
\
\'93You know quite well.\'94\
\
\'93I do not, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\
won\'92t exhibit Dorian Gray\'92s picture. I want the real reason.\'94\
\
\'93I told you the real reason.\'94\
\
\'93No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\
yourself in it. Now, that is childish.\'94\
\
\'93Harry,\'94 said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, \'93every\
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\
of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\
the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\
my own soul.\'94\
\
Lord Henry laughed. \'93And what is that?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93I will tell you,\'94 said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\
over his face.\
\
\'93I am all expectation, Basil,\'94 continued his companion, glancing at\
him.\
\
\'93Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,\'94 answered the painter;\
\'93and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\
believe it.\'94\
\
Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\
the grass and examined it. \'93I am quite sure I shall understand it,\'94 he\
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\
\'93and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\
is quite incredible.\'94\
\
The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\
lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\
languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\
blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\
wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward\'92s heart\
beating, and wondered what was coming.\
\
\'93The story is simply this,\'94 said the painter after some time. \'93Two\
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon\'92s. You know we poor\
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\
remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\
a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\
me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\
When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\
of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\
itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\
Then\'97but I don\'92t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\
exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\
not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\
no credit to myself for trying to escape.\'94\
\
\'93Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\
is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t believe that, Harry, and I don\'92t believe you do either.\
However, whatever was my motive\'97and it may have been pride, for I used\
to be very proud\'97I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\
stumbled against Lady Brandon. \'91You are not going to run away so soon,\
Mr. Hallward?\'92 she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?\'94\
\
\'93Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,\'94 said Lord Henry,\
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\
\
\'93I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\
with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\
parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\
once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\
some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\
been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\
nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\
stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\
It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\
would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\
that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\
to know each other.\'94\
\
\'93And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?\'94 asked his\
companion. \'93I know she goes in for giving a rapid _pr\'e9cis_ of all her\
guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\
everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\
like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\
exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\
to know.\'94\
\
\'93Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!\'94 said Hallward\
listlessly.\
\
\'93My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\
opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\
say about Mr. Dorian Gray?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, something like, \'91Charming boy\'97poor dear mother and I absolutely\
inseparable. Quite forget what he does\'97afraid he\'97doesn\'92t do\
anything\'97oh, yes, plays the piano\'97or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?\'92\
Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.\'94\
\
\'93Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\
the best ending for one,\'94 said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\
\
Hallward shook his head. \'93You don\'92t understand what friendship is,\
Harry,\'94 he murmured\'97\'93or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\
one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.\'94\
\
\'93How horribly unjust of you!\'94 cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\
and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\
glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\
summer sky. \'93Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\
between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\
acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\
intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\
have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\
power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\
me? I think it is rather vain.\'94\
\
\'93I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\
merely an acquaintance.\'94\
\
\'93My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.\'94\
\
\'93And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, brothers! I don\'92t care for brothers. My elder brother won\'92t die,\
and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.\'94\
\
\'93Harry!\'94 exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\
\
\'93My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can\'92t help detesting my\
relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\
other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\
with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\
of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\
immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\
us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\
poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\
magnificent. And yet I don\'92t suppose that ten per cent of the\
proletariat live correctly.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\
more, Harry, I feel sure you don\'92t either.\'94\
\
Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\
patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. \'93How English you are\
Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\
puts forward an idea to a true Englishman\'97always a rash thing to do\'97he\
never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\
only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\
oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\
the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\
are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\
will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\
wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don\'92t propose to\
discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\
better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\
than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\
How often do you see him?\'94\
\
\'93Every day. I couldn\'92t be happy if I didn\'92t see him every day. He is\
absolutely necessary to me.\'94\
\
\'93How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\
your art.\'94\
\
\'93He is all my art to me now,\'94 said the painter gravely. \'93I sometimes\
think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\
world\'92s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\
and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\
What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\
Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\
some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\
him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\
more to me than a model or a sitter. I won\'92t tell you that I am\
dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\
that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\
and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\
work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way\'97I wonder\
will you understand me?\'97his personality has suggested to me an entirely\
new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\
differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\
way that was hidden from me before. \'91A dream of form in days of\
thought\'92\'97who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\
has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad\'97for he seems to\
me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty\'97his merely\
visible presence\'97ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\
Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\
that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\
perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\
body\'97how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\
have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\
Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\
landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\
which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\
done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\
sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\
first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\
always looked for and always missed.\'94\
\
\'93Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.\'94\
\
Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\
some time he came back. \'93Harry,\'94 he said, \'93Dorian Gray is to me simply\
a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\
He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\
He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\
curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\
colours. That is all.\'94\
\
\'93Then why won\'92t you exhibit his portrait?\'94 asked Lord Henry.\
\
\'93Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\
all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\
cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\
anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\
soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\
their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry\'97too\
much of myself!\'94\
\
\'93Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\
is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.\'94\
\
\'93I hate them for it,\'94 cried Hallward. \'93An artist should create\
beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\
live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\
autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\
will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\
never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.\'94\
\
\'93I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won\'92t argue with you. It is only\
the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\
fond of you?\'94\
\
The painter considered for a few moments. \'93He likes me,\'94 he answered\
after a pause; \'93I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\
I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\
be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\
in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\
is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\
pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\
one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\
decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer\'92s day.\'94\
\
\'93Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,\'94 murmured Lord Henry.\
\'93Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\
of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\
accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\
ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\
something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\
facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\
well-informed man\'97that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\
thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\
_bric-\'e0-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\
its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\
you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\
out of drawing, or you won\'92t like his tone of colour, or something. You\
will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\
he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\
perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\
alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\
one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\
that it leaves one so unromantic.\'94\
\
\'93Harry, don\'92t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\
Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can\'92t feel what I feel. You change\
too often.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\
faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\
know love\'92s tragedies.\'94 And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\
silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\
satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\
a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\
and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\
swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\
people\'92s emotions were!\'97much more delightful than their ideas, it\
seemed to him. One\'92s own soul, and the passions of one\'92s friends\'97those\
were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\
amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\
with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt\'92s, he would have been sure\
to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\
been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\
lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\
virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\
The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\
eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\
all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\
turned to Hallward and said, \'93My dear fellow, I have just remembered.\'94\
\
\'93Remembered what, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.\'94\
\
\'93Where was it?\'94 asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\
\
\'93Don\'92t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha\'92s. She told\
me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\
in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\
that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\
of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\
earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\
creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\
about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.\'94\
\
\'93I am very glad you didn\'92t, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t want you to meet him.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t want me to meet him?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,\'94 said the butler, coming into\
the garden.\
\
\'93You must introduce me now,\'94 cried Lord Henry, laughing.\
\
The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\
\'93Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.\'94 The man\
bowed and went up the walk.\
\
Then he looked at Lord Henry. \'93Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,\'94 he\
said. \'93He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\
right in what she said of him. Don\'92t spoil him. Don\'92t try to influence\
him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\
marvellous people in it. Don\'92t take away from me the one person who\
gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\
depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.\'94 He spoke very slowly, and\
the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\
\
\'93What nonsense you talk!\'94 said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\
by the arm, he almost led him into the house.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II.\
\
\
As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\
his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann\'92s\
\'93Forest Scenes.\'94 \'93You must lend me these, Basil,\'94 he cried. \'93I want to\
learn them. They are perfectly charming.\'94\
\
\'93That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don\'92t want a life-sized portrait of\
myself,\'94 answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\
wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\
blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. \'93I beg your\
pardon, Basil, but I didn\'92t know you had any one with you.\'94\
\
\'93This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\
have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\
have spoiled everything.\'94\
\
\'93You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,\'94 said Lord\
Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. \'93My aunt has often\
spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\
afraid, one of her victims also.\'94\
\
\'93I am in Lady Agatha\'92s black books at present,\'94 answered Dorian with a\
funny look of penitence. \'93I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\
with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\
have played a duet together\'97three duets, I believe. I don\'92t know what\
she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\
And I don\'92t think it really matters about your not being there. The\
audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\
the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.\'94\
\
\'93That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,\'94 answered Dorian,\
laughing.\
\
Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\
with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\
gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\
once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth\'92s\
passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\
world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\
\
\'93You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray\'97far too\
charming.\'94 And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\
his cigarette-case.\
\
The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\
ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry\'92s last\
remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\
\'93Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\
awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?\'94\
\
Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. \'93Am I to go, Mr. Gray?\'94 he\
asked.\
\
\'93Oh, please don\'92t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\
moods, and I can\'92t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\
me why I should not go in for philanthropy.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\
subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\
shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don\'92t\
really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\
sitters to have some one to chat to.\'94\
\
Hallward bit his lip. \'93If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\
Dorian\'92s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.\'94\
\
Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. \'93You are very pressing, Basil,\
but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\
Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\
Street. I am nearly always at home at five o\'92clock. Write to me when\
you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.\'94\
\
\'93Basil,\'94 cried Dorian Gray, \'93if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\
too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\
horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\
him to stay. I insist upon it.\'94\
\
\'93Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,\'94 said Hallward,\
gazing intently at his picture. \'93It is quite true, I never talk when I\
am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\
for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.\'94\
\
\'93But what about my man at the Orleans?\'94\
\
The painter laughed. \'93I don\'92t think there will be any difficulty about\
that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\
and don\'92t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\
says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\
exception of myself.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\
martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\
he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\
delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\
moments he said to him, \'93Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\
Henry? As bad as Basil says?\'94\
\
\'93There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\
immoral\'97immoral from the scientific point of view.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93Because to influence a person is to give him one\'92s own soul. He does\
not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\
virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\
sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else\'92s music, an\
actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\
self-development. To realize one\'92s nature perfectly\'97that is what each\
of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\
forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one\'92s\
self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\
the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\
out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\
which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\
religion\'97these are the two things that govern us. And yet\'97\'94\
\
\'93Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\
boy,\'94 said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\
had come into the lad\'92s face that he had never seen there before.\
\
\'93And yet,\'94 continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\
that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\
him, and that he had even in his Eton days, \'93I believe that if one man\
were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\
every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream\'97I\
believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\
would forget all the maladies of medi\'e6valism, and return to the\
Hellenic ideal\'97to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\
may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\
mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\
that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\
that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\
sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\
purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\
or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\
to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\
the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\
monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\
the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\
brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\
also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\
rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\
thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\
dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame\'97\'94\
\
\'93Stop!\'94 faltered Dorian Gray, \'93stop! you bewilder me. I don\'92t know what\
to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don\'92t speak.\
Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.\'94\
\
For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\
eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\
influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\
really from himself. The few words that Basil\'92s friend had said to\
him\'97words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\
them\'97had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\
\
Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\
music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\
chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\
were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\
And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\
to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\
own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\
so real as words?\
\
Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\
He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\
seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\
it?\
\
With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\
psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\
He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\
and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\
which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\
He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\
fascinating the lad was!\
\
Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\
only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\
\
\'93Basil, I am tired of standing,\'94 cried Dorian Gray suddenly. \'93I must go\
out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.\'94\
\
\'93My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can\'92t think of\
anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\
I have caught the effect I wanted\'97the half-parted lips and the bright\
look in the eyes. I don\'92t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\
he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\
he has been paying you compliments. You mustn\'92t believe a word that he\
says.\'94\
\
\'93He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\
reason that I don\'92t believe anything he has told me.\'94\
\
\'93You know you believe it all,\'94 said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\
dreamy languorous eyes. \'93I will go out to the garden with you. It is\
horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\
something with strawberries in it.\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\
tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\
will join you later on. Don\'92t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\
in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\
masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.\'94\
\
Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\
face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\
perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\
upon his shoulder. \'93You are quite right to do that,\'94 he murmured.\
\'93Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\
senses but the soul.\'94\
\
The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\
tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\
was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\
suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 continued Lord Henry, \'93that is one of the great secrets of\
life\'97to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\
of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\
you know, just as you know less than you want to know.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\
olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\
something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\
cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\
as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\
But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\
left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\
Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\
him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\
have disclosed to him life\'92s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\
afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\
frightened.\
\
\'93Let us go and sit in the shade,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93Parker has brought\
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\
not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.\'94\
\
\'93What can it matter?\'94 cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\
the seat at the end of the garden.\
\
\'93It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\
worth having.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t feel that, Lord Henry.\'94\
\
\'93No, you don\'92t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\
ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\
branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\
feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\
always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\
Don\'92t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius\'97is higher,\
indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\
facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\
dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\
questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\
those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won\'92t\
smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\
may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\
beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\
judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\
the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\
what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\
which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\
beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\
are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\
mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\
defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\
dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\
roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\
will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\
Don\'92t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\
to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\
ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\
false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\
Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\
Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism\'97that is what our century wants.\
You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\
you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\
I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\
of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\
that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\
tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\
that your youth will last\'97such a little time. The common hill-flowers\
wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\
June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\
clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\
its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\
that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\
rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\
passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\
temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\
There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!\'94\
\
Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\
from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\
a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\
of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\
trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\
us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\
cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\
sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\
bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\
convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\
fro.\
\
Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\
staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\
smiled.\
\
\'93I am waiting,\'94 he cried. \'93Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\
you can bring your drinks.\'94\
\
They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\
butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\
the garden a thrush began to sing.\
\
\'93You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,\'94 said Lord Henry, looking at\
him.\
\
\'93Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?\'94\
\
\'93Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\
Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\
make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\
difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\
lasts a little longer.\'94\
\
As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry\'92s\
arm. \'93In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,\'94 he murmured,\
flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\
resumed his pose.\
\
Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\
The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\
broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\
to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\
streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\
heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\
\
After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\
a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\
biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. \'93It is quite\
finished,\'94 he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\
long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\
\
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a\
wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\
\
\'93My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,\'94 he said. \'93It is the\
finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at\
yourself.\'94\
\
The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\
\
\'93Is it really finished?\'94 he murmured, stepping down from the platform.\
\
\'93Quite finished,\'94 said the painter. \'93And you have sat splendidly\
to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.\'94\
\
\'93That is entirely due to me,\'94 broke in Lord Henry. \'93Isn\'92t it, Mr.\
Gray?\'94\
\
Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\
and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\
flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,\
as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there\
motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to\
him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own\
beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\
Basil Hallward\'92s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\
charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed\
at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\
come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\
terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and\
now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\
reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a\
day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\
colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet\
would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The\
life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\
dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\
\
As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\
knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes\
deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt\
as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\
\
\'93Don\'92t you like it?\'94 cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\
lad\'92s silence, not understanding what it meant.\
\
\'93Of course he likes it,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93Who wouldn\'92t like it? It is\
one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you\
like to ask for it. I must have it.\'94\
\
\'93It is not my property, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Whose property is it?\'94\
\
\'93Dorian\'92s, of course,\'94 answered the painter.\
\
\'93He is a very lucky fellow.\'94\
\
\'93How sad it is!\'94 murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon\
his own portrait. \'93How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and\
dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be\
older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other\
way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was\
to grow old! For that\'97for that\'97I would give everything! Yes, there is\
nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for\
that!\'94\
\
\'93You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,\'94 cried Lord\
Henry, laughing. \'93It would be rather hard lines on your work.\'94\
\
\'93I should object very strongly, Harry,\'94 said Hallward.\
\
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. \'93I believe you would, Basil. You\
like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a\
green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.\'94\
\
The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\
that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed\
and his cheeks burning.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he continued, \'93I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\
silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\
I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\
one\'92s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\
picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth\
is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I\
shall kill myself.\'94\
\
Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. \'93Dorian! Dorian!\'94 he cried,\
\'93don\'92t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I\
shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,\
are you?\'97you who are finer than any of them!\'94\
\
\'93I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\
the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must\
lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives\
something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture\
could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint\
it? It will mock me some day\'97mock me horribly!\'94 The hot tears welled\
into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the\
divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.\
\
\'93This is your doing, Harry,\'94 said the painter bitterly.\
\
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. \'93It is the real Dorian Gray\'97that is\
all.\'94\
\
\'93It is not.\'94\
\
\'93If it is not, what have I to do with it?\'94\
\
\'93You should have gone away when I asked you,\'94 he muttered.\
\
\'93I stayed when you asked me,\'94 was Lord Henry\'92s answer.\
\
\'93Harry, I can\'92t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\
you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\
done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will\
not let it come across our three lives and mar them.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid\
face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal\
painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was\
he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin\
tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long\
palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at\
last. He was going to rip up the canvas.\
\
With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\
Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\
the studio. \'93Don\'92t, Basil, don\'92t!\'94 he cried. \'93It would be murder!\'94\
\
\'93I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,\'94 said the painter\
coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. \'93I never thought you\
would.\'94\
\
\'93Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I\
feel that.\'94\
\
\'93Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\
sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.\'94 And he walked\
across the room and rang the bell for tea. \'93You will have tea, of\
course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\
pleasures?\'94\
\
\'93I adore simple pleasures,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93They are the last refuge\
of the complex. But I don\'92t like scenes, except on the stage. What\
absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as\
a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man\
is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after\
all\'97though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You\
had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn\'92t really\
want it, and I really do.\'94\
\
\'93If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!\'94\
cried Dorian Gray; \'93and I don\'92t allow people to call me a silly boy.\'94\
\
\'93You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\
existed.\'94\
\
\'93And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\
don\'92t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.\'94\
\
\'93I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.\'94\
\
There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden\
tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a\
rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\
Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray\
went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to\
the table and examined what was under the covers.\
\
\'93Let us go to the theatre to-night,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93There is sure to\
be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White\'92s, but it\
is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am\
ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent\
engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have\
all the surprise of candour.\'94\
\
\'93It is such a bore putting on one\'92s dress-clothes,\'94 muttered Hallward.\
\'93And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 answered Lord Henry dreamily, \'93the costume of the nineteenth\
century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only\
real colour-element left in modern life.\'94\
\
\'93You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one\
in the picture?\'94\
\
\'93Before either.\'94\
\
\'93I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,\'94 said the\
lad.\
\
\'93Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.\'94\
\
\'93Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.\'94\
\
\'93I should like that awfully.\'94\
\
The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.\
\'93I shall stay with the real Dorian,\'94 he said, sadly.\
\
\'93Is it the real Dorian?\'94 cried the original of the portrait, strolling\
across to him. \'93Am I really like that?\'94\
\
\'93Yes; you are just like that.\'94\
\
\'93How wonderful, Basil!\'94\
\
\'93At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,\'94\
sighed Hallward. \'93That is something.\'94\
\
\'93What a fuss people make about fidelity!\'94 exclaimed Lord Henry. \'93Why,\
even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to\
do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old\
men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,\'94 said Hallward. \'93Stop and\
dine with me.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t, Basil.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.\'94\
\
\'93He won\'92t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always\
breaks his own. I beg you not to go.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.\
\
\'93I entreat you.\'94\
\
The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them\
from the tea-table with an amused smile.\
\
\'93I must go, Basil,\'94 he answered.\
\
\'93Very well,\'94 said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on\
the tray. \'93It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better\
lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.\
Come to-morrow.\'94\
\
\'93Certainly.\'94\
\
\'93You won\'92t forget?\'94\
\
\'93No, of course not,\'94 cried Dorian.\
\
\'93And ... Harry!\'94\
\
\'93Yes, Basil?\'94\
\
\'93Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.\'94\
\
\'93I have forgotten it.\'94\
\
\'93I trust you.\'94\
\
\'93I wish I could trust myself,\'94 said Lord Henry, laughing. \'93Come, Mr.\
Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.\
Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.\'94\
\
As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a\
sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III.\
\
\
At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon\
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial\
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called\
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was\
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His\
father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and\
Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a\
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at\
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by\
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,\
and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his\
father\'92s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat\
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months\
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great\
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town\
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and\
took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the\
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself\
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of\
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of\
burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when\
the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them\
for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied\
him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.\
Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the\
country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but\
there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.\
\
When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough\
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. \'93Well,\
Harry,\'94 said the old gentleman, \'93what brings you out so early? I\
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till\
five.\'94\
\
\'93Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get\
something out of you.\'94\
\
\'93Money, I suppose,\'94 said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. \'93Well, sit\
down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that\
money is everything.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; \'93and\
when they grow older they know it. But I don\'92t want money. It is only\
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay\
mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly\
upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor\'92s tradesmen, and\
consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not\
useful information, of course; useless information.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,\
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in\
the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in\
now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure\
humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite\
enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for\
him.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,\'94 said\
Lord Henry languidly.\
\
\'93Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?\'94 asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy\
white eyebrows.\
\
\'93That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who\
he is. He is the last Lord Kelso\'92s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,\
Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What\
was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in\
your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in\
Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.\'94\
\
\'93Kelso\'92s grandson!\'94 echoed the old gentleman. \'93Kelso\'92s grandson! ... Of\
course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her\
christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret\
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless\
young fellow\'97a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or\
something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it\
happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few\
months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said\
Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his\
son-in-law in public\'97paid him, sir, to do it, paid him\'97and that the\
fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed\
up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time\
afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she\
never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl\
died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had\
forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he\
must be a good-looking chap.\'94\
\
\'93He is very good-looking,\'94 assented Lord Henry.\
\
\'93I hope he will fall into proper hands,\'94 continued the old man. \'93He\
should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing\
by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,\
through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a\
mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I\
was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble\
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made\
quite a story of it. I didn\'92t dare show my face at Court for a month. I\
hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 answered Lord Henry. \'93I fancy that the boy will be well\
off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...\
his mother was very beautiful?\'94\
\
\'93Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,\
Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could\
understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was\
mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family\
were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.\
Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at\
him, and there wasn\'92t a girl in London at the time who wasn\'92t after\
him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this\
humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an\
American? Ain\'92t English girls good enough for him?\'94\
\
\'93It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ll back English women against the world, Harry,\'94 said Lord Fermor,\
striking the table with his fist.\
\
\'93The betting is on the Americans.\'94\
\
\'93They don\'92t last, I am told,\'94 muttered his uncle.\
\
\'93A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a\
steeplechase. They take things flying. I don\'92t think Dartmoor has a\
chance.\'94\
\
\'93Who are her people?\'94 grumbled the old gentleman. \'93Has she got any?\'94\
\
Lord Henry shook his head. \'93American girls are as clever at concealing\
their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,\'94 he said,\
rising to go.\
\
\'93They are pork-packers, I suppose?\'94\
\
\'93I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor\'92s sake. I am told that\
pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after\
politics.\'94\
\
\'93Is she pretty?\'94\
\
\'93She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the\
secret of their charm.\'94\
\
\'93Why can\'92t these American women stay in their own country? They are\
always telling us that it is the paradise for women.\'94\
\
\'93It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively\
anxious to get out of it,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93Good-bye, Uncle George. I\
shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the\
information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new\
friends, and nothing about my old ones.\'94\
\
\'93Where are you lunching, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93At Aunt Agatha\'92s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest\
_prot\'e9g\'e9_.\'94\
\
\'93Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with\
her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that\
I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.\'94\
\
\'93All right, Uncle George, I\'92ll tell her, but it won\'92t have any effect.\
Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their\
distinguishing characteristic.\'94\
\
The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his\
servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and\
turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.\
\
So that was the story of Dorian Gray\'92s parentage. Crudely as it had\
been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a\
strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything\
for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a\
hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child\
born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to\
solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an\
interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it\
were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something\
tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might\
blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as\
with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat\
opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer\
rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing\
upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the\
bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of\
influence. No other activity was like it. To project one\'92s soul into\
some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one\'92s\
own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of\
passion and youth; to convey one\'92s temperament into another as though\
it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in\
that\'97perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited\
and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and\
grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,\
whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil\'92s studio, or could be\
fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the\
white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for\
us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made\
a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to\
fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how\
interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at\
life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who\
was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim\
woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,\
Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there\
had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful\
things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it\
were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they\
were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose\
shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something\
like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had\
first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the\
coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was\
strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without\
knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful\
portrait. He would seek to dominate him\'97had already, indeed, half done\
so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something\
fascinating in this son of love and death.\
\
Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had\
passed his aunt\'92s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.\
When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they\
had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and\
passed into the dining-room.\
\
\'93Late as usual, Harry,\'94 cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.\
\
He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to\
her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from\
the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.\
Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and\
good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample\
architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are\
described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on\
her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who\
followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the\
best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in\
accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was\
occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable\
charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,\
having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he\
had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,\
one of his aunt\'92s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so\
dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.\
Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most\
intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement\
in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely\
earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once\
himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of\
them ever quite escape.\
\
\'93We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,\'94 cried the duchess,\
nodding pleasantly to him across the table. \'93Do you think he will\
really marry this fascinating young person?\'94\
\
\'93I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.\'94\
\
\'93How dreadful!\'94 exclaimed Lady Agatha. \'93Really, some one should\
interfere.\'94\
\
\'93I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American\
dry-goods store,\'94 said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.\
\
\'93My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.\'94\
\
\'93Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?\'94 asked the duchess, raising\
her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.\
\
\'93American novels,\'94 answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.\
\
The duchess looked puzzled.\
\
\'93Don\'92t mind him, my dear,\'94 whispered Lady Agatha. \'93He never means\
anything that he says.\'94\
\
\'93When America was discovered,\'94 said the Radical member\'97and he began to\
give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a\
subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised\
her privilege of interruption. \'93I wish to goodness it never had been\
discovered at all!\'94 she exclaimed. \'93Really, our girls have no chance\
nowadays. It is most unfair.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,\'94 said Mr.\
Erskine; \'93I myself would say that it had merely been detected.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,\'94 answered the\
duchess vaguely. \'93I must confess that most of them are extremely\
pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.\
I wish I could afford to do the same.\'94\
\
\'93They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,\'94 chuckled Sir\
Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour\'92s cast-off clothes.\
\
\'93Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?\'94 inquired the\
duchess.\
\
\'93They go to America,\'94 murmured Lord Henry.\
\
Sir Thomas frowned. \'93I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against\
that great country,\'94 he said to Lady Agatha. \'93I have travelled all over\
it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are\
extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.\'94\
\
\'93But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?\'94 asked Mr.\
Erskine plaintively. \'93I don\'92t feel up to the journey.\'94\
\
Sir Thomas waved his hand. \'93Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on\
his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about\
them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are\
absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing\
characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I\
assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.\'94\
\
\'93How dreadful!\'94 cried Lord Henry. \'93I can stand brute force, but brute\
reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It\
is hitting below the intellect.\'94\
\
\'93I do not understand you,\'94 said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.\
\
\'93I do, Lord Henry,\'94 murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.\
\
\'93Paradoxes are all very well in their way....\'94 rejoined the baronet.\
\
\'93Was that a paradox?\'94 asked Mr. Erskine. \'93I did not think so. Perhaps\
it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality\
we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we\
can judge them.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me!\'94 said Lady Agatha, \'93how you men argue! I am sure I never can\
make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with\
you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the\
East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love\
his playing.\'94\
\
\'93I want him to play to me,\'94 cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked\
down the table and caught a bright answering glance.\
\
\'93But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,\'94 continued Lady Agatha.\
\
\'93I can sympathize with everything except suffering,\'94 said Lord Henry,\
shrugging his shoulders. \'93I cannot sympathize with that. It is too\
ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid\
in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the\
colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life\'92s sores,\
the better.\'94\
\
\'93Still, the East End is a very important problem,\'94 remarked Sir Thomas\
with a grave shake of the head.\
\
\'93Quite so,\'94 answered the young lord. \'93It is the problem of slavery, and\
we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.\'94\
\
The politician looked at him keenly. \'93What change do you propose,\
then?\'94 he asked.\
\
Lord Henry laughed. \'93I don\'92t desire to change anything in England\
except the weather,\'94 he answered. \'93I am quite content with philosophic\
contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through\
an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal\
to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that\
they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not\
emotional.\'94\
\
\'93But we have such grave responsibilities,\'94 ventured Mrs. Vandeleur\
timidly.\
\
\'93Terribly grave,\'94 echoed Lady Agatha.\
\
Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. \'93Humanity takes itself too\
seriously. It is the world\'92s original sin. If the caveman had known how\
to laugh, history would have been different.\'94\
\
\'93You are really very comforting,\'94 warbled the duchess. \'93I have always\
felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no\
interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look\
her in the face without a blush.\'94\
\
\'93A blush is very becoming, Duchess,\'94 remarked Lord Henry.\
\
\'93Only when one is young,\'94 she answered. \'93When an old woman like myself\
blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell\
me how to become young again.\'94\
\
He thought for a moment. \'93Can you remember any great error that you\
committed in your early days, Duchess?\'94 he asked, looking at her across\
the table.\
\
\'93A great many, I fear,\'94 she cried.\
\
\'93Then commit them over again,\'94 he said gravely. \'93To get back one\'92s\
youth, one has merely to repeat one\'92s follies.\'94\
\
\'93A delightful theory!\'94 she exclaimed. \'93I must put it into practice.\'94\
\
\'93A dangerous theory!\'94 came from Sir Thomas\'92s tight lips. Lady Agatha\
shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he continued, \'93that is one of the great secrets of life.\
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and\
discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are\
one\'92s mistakes.\'94\
\
A laugh ran round the table.\
\
He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and\
transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent\
with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went\
on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and\
catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her\
wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the\
hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled\
before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge\
press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round\
her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over\
the vat\'92s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary\
improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,\
and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose\
temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and\
to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,\
irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they\
followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,\
but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips\
and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.\
\
At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room\
in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was\
waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. \'93How annoying!\'94 she\
cried. \'93I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take\
him to some absurd meeting at Willis\'92s Rooms, where he is going to be\
in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn\'92t\
have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would\
ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are\
quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don\'92t know\
what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some\
night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?\'94\
\
\'93For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,\'94 said Lord Henry with a\
bow.\
\
\'93Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,\'94 she cried; \'93so mind you\
come\'94; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the\
other ladies.\
\
When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking\
a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.\
\
\'93You talk books away,\'94 he said; \'93why don\'92t you write one?\'94\
\
\'93I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I\
should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely\
as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in\
England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of\
all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty\
of literature.\'94\
\
\'93I fear you are right,\'94 answered Mr. Erskine. \'93I myself used to have\
literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young\
friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really\
meant all that you said to us at lunch?\'94\
\
\'93I quite forget what I said,\'94 smiled Lord Henry. \'93Was it all very bad?\'94\
\
\'93Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if\
anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being\
primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The\
generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are\
tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your\
philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate\
enough to possess.\'94\
\
\'93I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It\
has a perfect host, and a perfect library.\'94\
\
\'93You will complete it,\'94 answered the old gentleman with a courteous\
bow. \'93And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at\
the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.\'94\
\
\'93All of you, Mr. Erskine?\'94\
\
\'93Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English\
Academy of Letters.\'94\
\
Lord Henry laughed and rose. \'93I am going to the park,\'94 he cried.\
\
As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.\
\'93Let me come with you,\'94 he murmured.\
\
\'93But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,\'94\
answered Lord Henry.\
\
\'93I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let\
me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so\
wonderfully as you do.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,\'94 said Lord Henry, smiling.\
\'93All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with\
me, if you care to.\'94\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV.\
\
\
One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious\
arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry\'92s house in Mayfair. It\
was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled\
wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling\
of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,\
long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette\
by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for\
Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies\
that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and\
parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small\
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a\
summer day in London.\
\
Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his\
principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was\
looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages\
of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had\
found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the\
Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going\
away.\
\
At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. \'93How late you\
are, Harry!\'94 he murmured.\
\
\'93I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,\'94 answered a shrill voice.\
\
He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. \'93I beg your pardon. I\
thought\'97\'94\
\
\'93You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me\
introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my\
husband has got seventeen of them.\'94\
\
\'93Not seventeen, Lady Henry?\'94\
\
\'93Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the\
opera.\'94 She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her\
vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always\
looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.\
She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never\
returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look\
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,\
and she had a perfect mania for going to church.\
\
\'93That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?\'94\
\
\'93Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner\'92s music better than\
anybody\'92s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other\
people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don\'92t you\
think so, Mr. Gray?\'94\
\
The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her\
fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.\
\
Dorian smiled and shook his head: \'93I am afraid I don\'92t think so, Lady\
Henry. I never talk during music\'97at least, during good music. If one\
hears bad music, it is one\'92s duty to drown it in conversation.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! that is one of Harry\'92s views, isn\'92t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear\
Harry\'92s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of\
them. But you must not think I don\'92t like good music. I adore it, but I\
am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped\
pianists\'97two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don\'92t know what it\
is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,\
ain\'92t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after\
a time, don\'92t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to\
art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn\'92t it? You have never been to\
any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can\'92t afford\
orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one\'92s rooms\
look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for\
you, to ask you something\'97I forget what it was\'97and I found Mr. Gray\
here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the\
same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been\
most pleasant. I am so glad I\'92ve seen him.\'94\
\
\'93I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,\'94 said Lord Henry, elevating his\
dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused\
smile. \'93So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old\
brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays\
people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\'94\
\
\'93I am afraid I must be going,\'94 exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an\
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. \'93I have promised to drive\
with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining\
out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say, my dear,\'94 said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her\
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the\
rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of\
frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the\
sofa.\
\
\'93Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,\'94 he said after a\
few puffs.\
\
\'93Why, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93Because they are so sentimental.\'94\
\
\'93But I like sentimental people.\'94\
\
\'93Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,\
because they are curious: both are disappointed.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That\
is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do\
everything that you say.\'94\
\
\'93Who are you in love with?\'94 asked Lord Henry after a pause.\
\
\'93With an actress,\'94 said Dorian Gray, blushing.\
\
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. \'93That is a rather commonplace\
_d\'e9but_.\'94\
\
\'93You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Who is she?\'94\
\
\'93Her name is Sibyl Vane.\'94\
\
\'93Never heard of her.\'94\
\
\'93No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.\'94\
\
\'93My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They\
never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent\
the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of\
mind over morals.\'94\
\
\'93Harry, how can you?\'94\
\
\'93My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so\
I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I\
find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and\
the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a\
reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to\
supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,\
however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers\
painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used\
to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten\
years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for\
conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and\
two of these can\'92t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me\
about your genius. How long have you known her?\'94\
\
\'93Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.\'94\
\
\'93Never mind that. How long have you known her?\'94\
\
\'93About three weeks.\'94\
\
\'93And where did you come across her?\'94\
\
\'93I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn\'92t be unsympathetic about it.\
After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You\
filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days\
after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in\
the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who\
passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they\
led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There\
was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....\
Well, one evening about seven o\'92clock, I determined to go out in search\
of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with\
its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as\
you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a\
thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I\
remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we\
first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret\
of life. I don\'92t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered\
eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black\
grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little\
theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous\
Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was\
standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,\
and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. \'91Have a\
box, my Lord?\'92 he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an\
air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that\
amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I\
really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the\
present day I can\'92t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn\'92t\'97my dear\
Harry, if I hadn\'92t\'97I should have missed the greatest romance of my\
life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!\'94\
\
\'93I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you\
should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the\
first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will\
always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of\
people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes\
of a country. Don\'92t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for\
you. This is merely the beginning.\'94\
\
\'93Do you think my nature so shallow?\'94 cried Dorian Gray angrily.\
\
\'93No; I think your nature so deep.\'94\
\
\'93How do you mean?\'94\
\
\'93My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really\
the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I\
call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.\
Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life\
of the intellect\'97simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must\
analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many\
things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might\
pick them up. But I don\'92t want to interrupt you. Go on with your\
story.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\
vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the\
curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and\
cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were\
fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and\
there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the\
dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there\
was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.\'94\
\
\'93It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.\'94\
\
\'93Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what\
on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you\
think the play was, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93I should think \'91The Idiot Boy\'92, or \'91Dumb but Innocent\'92. Our fathers\
used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,\
the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is\
not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandp\'e8res ont\
toujours tort_.\'94\
\
\'93This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I\
must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare\
done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a\
sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There\
was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a\
cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene\
was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,\
with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a\
beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the\
low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most\
friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the\
scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But\
Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a\
little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of\
dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were\
like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen\
in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that\
beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,\
Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came\
across me. And her voice\'97I never heard such a voice. It was very low at\
first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one\'92s\
ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a\
distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy\
that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There\
were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You\
know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane\
are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear\
them, and each of them says something different. I don\'92t know which to\
follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is\
everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One\
evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have\
seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from\
her lover\'92s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of\
Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.\
She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and\
given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been\
innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike\
throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary\
women never appeal to one\'92s imagination. They are limited to their\
century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as\
easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is\
no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and\
chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped\
smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an\
actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn\'92t you tell me\
that the only thing worth loving is an actress?\'94\
\
\'93Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary\
charm in them, sometimes,\'94 said Lord Henry.\
\
\'93I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.\'94\
\
\'93You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life\
you will tell me everything you do.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.\
You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would\
come and confess it to you. You would understand me.\'94\
\
\'93People like you\'97the wilful sunbeams of life\'97don\'92t commit crimes,\
Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now\
tell me\'97reach me the matches, like a good boy\'97thanks\'97what are your\
actual relations with Sibyl Vane?\'94\
\
Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\
\'93Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!\'94\
\
\'93It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,\'94 said\
Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. \'93But why\
should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When\
one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one\'92s self, and one\
always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a\
romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?\'94\
\
\'93Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the\
horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and\
offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was\
furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds\
of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I\
think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the\
impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.\'94\
\
\'93I am not surprised.\'94\
\
\'93Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I\
never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and\
confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy\
against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.\'94\
\
\'93I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other\
hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all\
expensive.\'94\
\
\'93Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,\'94 laughed Dorian.\
\'93By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,\
and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly\
recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the\
place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I\
was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though\
he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with\
an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to \'91The\
Bard,\'92 as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a\
distinction.\'94\
\
\'93It was a distinction, my dear Dorian\'97a great distinction. Most people\
become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of\
life. To have ruined one\'92s self over poetry is an honour. But when did\
you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?\'94\
\
\'93The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going\
round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me\'97at least\
I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed\
determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not\
wanting to know her, wasn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93No; I don\'92t think so.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Harry, why?\'94\
\
\'93I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.\'94\
\
\'93Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child\
about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her\
what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of\
her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood\
grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate\
speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like\
children. He would insist on calling me \'91My Lord,\'92 so I had to assure\
Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,\
\'91You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.\'92\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in\
a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded\
tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta\
dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen\
better days.\'94\
\
\'93I know that look. It depresses me,\'94 murmured Lord Henry, examining his\
rings.\
\
\'93The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest\
me.\'94\
\
\'93You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about\
other people\'92s tragedies.\'94\
\
\'93Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came\
from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and\
entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every\
night she is more marvellous.\'94\
\
\'93That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I\
thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is\
not quite what I expected.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have\
been to the opera with you several times,\'94 said Dorian, opening his\
blue eyes in wonder.\
\
\'93You always come dreadfully late.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I can\'92t help going to see Sibyl play,\'94 he cried, \'93even if it is\
only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think\
of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I\
am filled with awe.\'94\
\
\'93You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can\'92t you?\'94\
\
He shook his head. \'93To-night she is Imogen,\'94 he answered, \'93and\
to-morrow night she will be Juliet.\'94\
\
\'93When is she Sibyl Vane?\'94\
\
\'93Never.\'94\
\
\'93I congratulate you.\'94\
\
\'93How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.\
She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has\
genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the\
secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to\
make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our\
laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their\
dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,\
how I worship her!\'94 He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.\
Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.\
\
Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different\
he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward\'92s\
studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of\
scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and\
desire had come to meet it on the way.\
\
\'93And what do you propose to do?\'94 said Lord Henry at last.\
\
\'93I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I\
have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to\
acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew\'92s hands.\
She is bound to him for three years\'97at least for two years and eight\
months\'97from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of\
course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and\
bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made\
me.\'94\
\
\'93That would be impossible, my dear boy.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in\
her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it\
is personalities, not principles, that move the age.\'94\
\
\'93Well, what night shall we go?\'94\
\
\'93Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet\
to-morrow.\'94\
\
\'93All right. The Bristol at eight o\'92clock; and I will get Basil.\'94\
\
\'93Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the\
curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets\
Romeo.\'94\
\
\'93Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or\
reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before\
seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to\
him?\'94\
\
\'93Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather\
horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful\
frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous\
of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit\
that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don\'92t want\
to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good\
advice.\'94\
\
Lord Henry smiled. \'93People are very fond of giving away what they need\
most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit\
of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered\
that.\'94\
\
\'93Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his\
work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his\
prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I\
have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good\
artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly\
uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is\
the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely\
fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they\
look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets\
makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot\
write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.\'94\
\
\'93I wonder is that really so, Harry?\'94 said Dorian Gray, putting some\
perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that\
stood on the table. \'93It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.\
Imogen is waiting for me. Don\'92t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.\'94\
\
As he left the room, Lord Henry\'92s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began\
to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as\
Dorian Gray, and yet the lad\'92s mad adoration of some one else caused\
him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by\
it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled\
by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of\
that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had\
begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.\
Human life\'97that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.\
Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as\
one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one\
could not wear over one\'92s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous\
fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with\
monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle\
that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were\
maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to\
understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!\
How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard\
logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect\'97to\
observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they\
were in unison, and at what point they were at discord\'97there was a\
delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too\
high a price for any sensation.\
\
He was conscious\'97and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his\
brown agate eyes\'97that it was through certain words of his, musical\
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray\'92s soul had turned\
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent\
the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was\
something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its\
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were\
revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect\
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately\
with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex\
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,\
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,\
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.\
\
Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was\
yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was\
becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his\
beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It\
was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one\
of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be\
remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one\'92s sense of beauty, and\
whose wounds are like red roses.\
\
Soul and body, body and soul\'97how mysterious they were! There was\
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\
The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say\
where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How\
shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And\
yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!\
Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body\
really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit\
from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a\
mystery also.\
\
He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a\
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it\
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.\
Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to\
their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of\
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation\
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow\
and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in\
experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.\
All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same\
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we\
would do many times, and with joy.\
\
It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by\
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and\
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to\
promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane\
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt\
that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new\
experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex\
passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of\
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,\
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from\
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the\
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most\
strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we\
were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were\
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.\
\
While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the\
door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for\
dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had\
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The\
panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a\
faded rose. He thought of his friend\'92s young fiery-coloured life and\
wondered how it was all going to end.\
\
When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o\'92clock, he saw a telegram\
lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian\
Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl\
Vane.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V.\
\
\
\'93Mother, Mother, I am so happy!\'94 whispered the girl, burying her face\
in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to\
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their\
dingy sitting-room contained. \'93I am so happy!\'94 she repeated, \'93and you\
must be happy, too!\'94\
\
Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her\
daughter\'92s head. \'93Happy!\'94 she echoed, \'93I am only happy, Sibyl, when I\
see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs\
has been very good to us, and we owe him money.\'94\
\
The girl looked up and pouted. \'93Money, Mother?\'94 she cried, \'93what does\
money matter? Love is more than money.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to\
get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty\
pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.\'94\
\
\'93He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,\'94\
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.\
\
\'93I don\'92t know how we could manage without him,\'94 answered the elder\
woman querulously.\
\
Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. \'93We don\'92t want him any more,\
Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.\'94 Then she paused. A rose\
shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the\
petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept\
over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. \'93I love him,\'94 she\
said simply.\
\
\'93Foolish child! foolish child!\'94 was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.\
The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the\
words.\
\
The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her\
eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a\
moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a\
dream had passed across them.\
\
Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at\
prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name\
of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of\
passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on\
memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it\
had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids\
were warm with his breath.\
\
Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This\
young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against\
the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of\
craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.\
\
Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.\
\'93Mother, Mother,\'94 she cried, \'93why does he love me so much? I know why I\
love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.\
But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet\'97why, I\
cannot tell\'97though I feel so much beneath him, I don\'92t feel humble. I\
feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love\
Prince Charming?\'94\
\
The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her\
cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to\
her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. \'93Forgive me,\
Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains\
you because you loved him so much. Don\'92t look so sad. I am as happy\
to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!\'94\
\
\'93My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,\
what do you know of this young man? You don\'92t even know his name. The\
whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away\
to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you\
should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he\
is rich ...\'94\
\
\'93Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!\'94\
\
Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical\
gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a\
stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened\
and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was\
thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat\
clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would\
hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.\
Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally\
elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the\
_tableau_ was interesting.\
\
\'93You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,\'94 said the\
lad with a good-natured grumble.\
\
\'93Ah! but you don\'92t like being kissed, Jim,\'94 she cried. \'93You are a\
dreadful old bear.\'94 And she ran across the room and hugged him.\
\
James Vane looked into his sister\'92s face with tenderness. \'93I want you\
to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don\'92t suppose I shall ever see\
this horrid London again. I am sure I don\'92t want to.\'94\
\
\'93My son, don\'92t say such dreadful things,\'94 murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up\
a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She\
felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would\
have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.\
\
\'93Why not, Mother? I mean it.\'94\
\
\'93You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a\
position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the\
Colonies\'97nothing that I would call society\'97so when you have made your\
fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.\'94\
\
\'93Society!\'94 muttered the lad. \'93I don\'92t want to know anything about that.\
I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I\
hate it.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, Jim!\'94 said Sibyl, laughing, \'93how unkind of you! But are you really\
going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were\
going to say good-bye to some of your friends\'97to Tom Hardy, who gave\
you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking\
it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where\
shall we go? Let us go to the park.\'94\
\
\'93I am too shabby,\'94 he answered, frowning. \'93Only swell people go to the\
park.\'94\
\
\'93Nonsense, Jim,\'94 she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.\
\
He hesitated for a moment. \'93Very well,\'94 he said at last, \'93but don\'92t be\
too long dressing.\'94 She danced out of the door. One could hear her\
singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.\
\
He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to\
the still figure in the chair. \'93Mother, are my things ready?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93Quite ready, James,\'94 she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For\
some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this\
rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when\
their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The\
silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.\
She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as\
they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. \'93I hope you will be\
contented, James, with your sea-faring life,\'94 she said. \'93You must\
remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a\
solicitor\'92s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the\
country often dine with the best families.\'94\
\
\'93I hate offices, and I hate clerks,\'94 he replied. \'93But you are quite\
right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don\'92t\
let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.\'94\
\
\'93James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.\'94\
\
\'93I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to\
talk to her. Is that right? What about that?\'94\
\
\'93You are speaking about things you don\'92t understand, James. In the\
profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying\
attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was\
when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at\
present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt\
that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always\
most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and\
the flowers he sends are lovely.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t know his name, though,\'94 said the lad harshly.\
\
\'93No,\'94 answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. \'93He has\
not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He\
is probably a member of the aristocracy.\'94\
\
James Vane bit his lip. \'93Watch over Sibyl, Mother,\'94 he cried, \'93watch\
over her.\'94\
\
\'93My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special\
care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why\
she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the\
aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a\
most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.\
His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.\'94\
\
The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane\
with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when\
the door opened and Sibyl ran in.\
\
\'93How serious you both are!\'94 she cried. \'93What is the matter?\'94\
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 he answered. \'93I suppose one must be serious sometimes.\
Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o\'92clock. Everything is\
packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.\'94\
\
\'93Good-bye, my son,\'94 she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.\
\
She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and\
there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.\
\
\'93Kiss me, Mother,\'94 said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the\
withered cheek and warmed its frost.\
\
\'93My child! my child!\'94 cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in\
search of an imaginary gallery.\
\
\'93Come, Sibyl,\'94 said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother\'92s\
affectations.\
\
They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled\
down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the\
sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the\
company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common\
gardener walking with a rose.\
\
Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of\
some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on\
geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,\
was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was\
trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,\
and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,\
but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about\
the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life\
he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not\
to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.\
Oh, no! A sailor\'92s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a\
horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a\
black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long\
screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a\
polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.\
Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure\
gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it\
down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The\
bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with\
immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.\
They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other\
in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,\
and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful\
heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,\
and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with\
her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense\
house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.\
But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money\
foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much\
more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and\
to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very\
good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a\
few years he would come back quite rich and happy.\
\
The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick\
at leaving home.\
\
Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.\
Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger\
of Sibyl\'92s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could\
mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated\
him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,\
and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was\
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother\'92s nature,\
and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl\'92s happiness.\
Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge\
them; sometimes they forgive them.\
\
His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that\
he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he\
had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears\
one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of\
horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a\
hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like\
furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.\
\
\'93You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,\'94 cried Sibyl, \'93and I\
am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.\'94\
\
\'93What do you want me to say?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,\'94 she answered,\
smiling at him.\
\
He shrugged his shoulders. \'93You are more likely to forget me than I am\
to forget you, Sibyl.\'94\
\
She flushed. \'93What do you mean, Jim?\'94 she asked.\
\
\'93You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me\
about him? He means you no good.\'94\
\
\'93Stop, Jim!\'94 she exclaimed. \'93You must not say anything against him. I\
love him.\'94\
\
\'93Why, you don\'92t even know his name,\'94 answered the lad. \'93Who is he? I\
have a right to know.\'94\
\
\'93He is called Prince Charming. Don\'92t you like the name. Oh! you silly\
boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think\
him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet\
him\'97when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.\
Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the\
theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!\
how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have\
him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten\
the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass\
one\'92s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting \'91genius\'92 to his\
loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will\
announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,\
Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor\
beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the\
door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.\
They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I\
think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.\'94\
\
\'93He is a gentleman,\'94 said the lad sullenly.\
\
\'93A prince!\'94 she cried musically. \'93What more do you want?\'94\
\
\'93He wants to enslave you.\'94\
\
\'93I shudder at the thought of being free.\'94\
\
\'93I want you to beware of him.\'94\
\
\'93To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.\'94\
\
\'93Sibyl, you are mad about him.\'94\
\
She laughed and took his arm. \'93You dear old Jim, you talk as if you\
were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will\
know what it is. Don\'92t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to\
think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have\
ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and\
difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,\
and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the\
smart people go by.\'94\
\
They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across\
the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust\'97tremulous\
cloud of orris-root it seemed\'97hung in the panting air. The brightly\
coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.\
\
She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He\
spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as\
players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not\
communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all\
the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she\
caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open\
carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.\
\
She started to her feet. \'93There he is!\'94 she cried.\
\
\'93Who?\'94 said Jim Vane.\
\
\'93Prince Charming,\'94 she answered, looking after the victoria.\
\
He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. \'93Show him to me. Which\
is he? Point him out. I must see him!\'94 he exclaimed; but at that moment\
the Duke of Berwick\'92s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left\
the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.\
\
\'93He is gone,\'94 murmured Sibyl sadly. \'93I wish you had seen him.\'94\
\
\'93I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does\
you any wrong, I shall kill him.\'94\
\
She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air\
like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to\
her tittered.\
\
\'93Come away, Jim; come away,\'94 she whispered. He followed her doggedly as\
she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.\
\
When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity\
in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at\
him. \'93You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that\
is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don\'92t know what you\
are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you\
would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was\
wicked.\'94\
\
\'93I am sixteen,\'94 he answered, \'93and I know what I am about. Mother is no\
help to you. She doesn\'92t understand how to look after you. I wish now\
that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck\
the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn\'92t been signed.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, don\'92t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those\
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going\
to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect\
happiness. We won\'92t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I\
love, would you?\'94\
\
\'93Not as long as you love him, I suppose,\'94 was the sullen answer.\
\
\'93I shall love him for ever!\'94 she cried.\
\
\'93And he?\'94\
\
\'93For ever, too!\'94\
\
\'93He had better.\'94\
\
She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He\
was merely a boy.\
\
At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to\
their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o\'92clock, and\
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted\
that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when\
their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he\
detested scenes of every kind.\
\
In Sybil\'92s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad\'92s heart,\
and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,\
had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,\
and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her\
with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went\
downstairs.\
\
His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his\
unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his\
meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the\
stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of\
street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that\
was left to him.\
\
After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his\
hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to\
him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother\
watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace\
handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got\
up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their\
eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.\
\
\'93Mother, I have something to ask you,\'94 he said. Her eyes wandered\
vaguely about the room. She made no answer. \'93Tell me the truth. I have\
a right to know. Were you married to my father?\'94\
\
She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,\
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,\
had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure\
it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question\
called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up\
to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.\
\
\'93No,\'94 she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.\
\
\'93My father was a scoundrel then!\'94 cried the lad, clenching his fists.\
\
She shook her head. \'93I knew he was not free. We loved each other very\
much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don\'92t speak\
against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he\
was highly connected.\'94\
\
An oath broke from his lips. \'93I don\'92t care for myself,\'94 he exclaimed,\
\'93but don\'92t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn\'92t it, who is in love\
with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.\'94\
\
For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her\
head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. \'93Sibyl has a\
mother,\'94 she murmured; \'93I had none.\'94\
\
The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed\
her. \'93I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,\'94 he\
said, \'93but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don\'92t forget\
that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me\
that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him\
down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.\'94\
\
The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that\
accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid\
to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,\
and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She\
would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional\
scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers\
looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the\
bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It\
was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the\
tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She\
was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled\
herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now\
that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.\
It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and\
dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some\
day.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI.\
\
\
\'93I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?\'94 said Lord Henry that\
evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol\
where dinner had been laid for three.\
\
\'93No, Harry,\'94 answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing\
waiter. \'93What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don\'92t\
interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons\
worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little\
whitewashing.\'94\
\
\'93Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,\'94 said Lord Henry, watching him\
as he spoke.\
\
Hallward started and then frowned. \'93Dorian engaged to be married!\'94 he\
cried. \'93Impossible!\'94\
\
\'93It is perfectly true.\'94\
\
\'93To whom?\'94\
\
\'93To some little actress or other.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.\'94\
\
\'93Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear\
Basil.\'94\
\
\'93Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Except in America,\'94 rejoined Lord Henry languidly. \'93But I didn\'92t say\
he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great\
difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have\
no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I\
never was engaged.\'94\
\
\'93But think of Dorian\'92s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be\
absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.\'94\
\
\'93If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is\
sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it\
is always from the noblest motives.\'94\
\
\'93I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don\'92t want to see Dorian tied to\
some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his\
intellect.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, she is better than good\'97she is beautiful,\'94 murmured Lord Henry,\
sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. \'93Dorian says she is\
beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your\
portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal\
appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst\
others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn\'92t forget his\
appointment.\'94\
\
\'93Are you serious?\'94\
\
\'93Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever\
be more serious than I am at the present moment.\'94\
\
\'93But do you approve of it, Harry?\'94 asked the painter, walking up and\
down the room and biting his lip. \'93You can\'92t approve of it, possibly.\
It is some silly infatuation.\'94\
\
\'93I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd\
attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air\
our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people\
say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a\
personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality\
selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with\
a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?\
If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know\
I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that\
it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack\
individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage\
makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other\
egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more\
highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the\
object of man\'92s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and\
whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I\
hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore\
her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one\
else. He would be a wonderful study.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don\'92t.\
If Dorian Gray\'92s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than\
yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.\'94\
\
Lord Henry laughed. \'93The reason we all like to think so well of others\
is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer\
terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour\
with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to\
us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find\
good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our\
pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest\
contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but\
one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have\
merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,\
but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I\
will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being\
fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I\
can.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!\'94 said the\
lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and\
shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. \'93I have never been so\
happy. Of course, it is sudden\'97all really delightful things are. And\
yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my\
life.\'94 He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked\
extraordinarily handsome.\
\
\'93I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,\'94 said Hallward, \'93but I\
don\'92t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.\
You let Harry know.\'94\
\
\'93And I don\'92t forgive you for being late for dinner,\'94 broke in Lord\
Henry, putting his hand on the lad\'92s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.\
\'93Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and\
then you will tell us how it all came about.\'94\
\
\'93There is really not much to tell,\'94 cried Dorian as they took their\
seats at the small round table. \'93What happened was simply this. After I\
left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that\
little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and\
went down at eight o\'92clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.\
Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!\
You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy\'92s clothes, she\
was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with\
cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little\
green cap with a hawk\'92s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak\
lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had\
all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your\
studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round\
a pale rose. As for her acting\'97well, you shall see her to-night. She is\
simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I\
forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away\
with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the\
performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were\
sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had\
never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each\
other. I can\'92t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to\
me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of\
rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white\
narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I\
feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can\'92t help it. Of\
course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own\
mother. I don\'92t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to\
be furious. I don\'92t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and\
then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven\'92t I, to take\
my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare\'92s plays? Lips\
that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.\
I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the\
mouth.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,\'94 said Hallward slowly.\
\
\'93Have you seen her to-day?\'94 asked Lord Henry.\
\
Dorian Gray shook his head. \'93I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall\
find her in an orchard in Verona.\'94\
\
Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. \'93At what\
particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what\
did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did\
not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said\
she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is\
nothing to me compared with her.\'94\
\
\'93Women are wonderfully practical,\'94 murmured Lord Henry, \'93much more\
practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to\
say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.\'94\
\
Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. \'93Don\'92t, Harry. You have annoyed\
Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any\
one. His nature is too fine for that.\'94\
\
Lord Henry looked across the table. \'93Dorian is never annoyed with me,\'94\
he answered. \'93I asked the question for the best reason possible, for\
the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any\
question\'97simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women\
who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of\
course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not\
modern.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. \'93You are quite incorrigible,\
Harry; but I don\'92t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When\
you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her\
would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any\
one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to\
place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman\
who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for\
that. Ah! don\'92t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her\
trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,\
I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you\
have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane\'92s\
hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,\
delightful theories.\'94\
\
\'93And those are ...?\'94 asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.\
\
\'93Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories\
about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,\'94 he answered\
in his slow melodious voice. \'93But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory\
as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature\'92s test,\
her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when\
we are good, we are not always happy.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! but what do you mean by good?\'94 cried Basil Hallward.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord\
Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the\
centre of the table, \'93what do you mean by good, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93To be good is to be in harmony with one\'92s self,\'94 he replied, touching\
the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.\
\'93Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One\'92s own\
life\'97that is the important thing. As for the lives of one\'92s neighbours,\
if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one\'92s moral\
views about them, but they are not one\'92s concern. Besides,\
individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in\
accepting the standard of one\'92s age. I consider that for any man of\
culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest\
immorality.\'94\
\
\'93But, surely, if one lives merely for one\'92s self, Harry, one pays a\
terrible price for doing so?\'94 suggested the painter.\
\
\'93Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that\
the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but\
self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege\
of the rich.\'94\
\
\'93One has to pay in other ways but money.\'94\
\
\'93What sort of ways, Basil?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the\
consciousness of degradation.\'94\
\
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. \'93My dear fellow, medi\'e6val art is\
charming, but medi\'e6val emotions are out of date. One can use them in\
fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in\
fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,\
no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever\
knows what a pleasure is.\'94\
\
\'93I know what pleasure is,\'94 cried Dorian Gray. \'93It is to adore some\
one.\'94\
\
\'93That is certainly better than being adored,\'94 he answered, toying with\
some fruits. \'93Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as\
humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us\
to do something for them.\'94\
\
\'93I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to\
us,\'94 murmured the lad gravely. \'93They create love in our natures. They\
have a right to demand it back.\'94\
\
\'93That is quite true, Dorian,\'94 cried Hallward.\
\
\'93Nothing is ever quite true,\'94 said Lord Henry.\
\
\'93This is,\'94 interrupted Dorian. \'93You must admit, Harry, that women give\
to men the very gold of their lives.\'94\
\
\'93Possibly,\'94 he sighed, \'93but they invariably want it back in such very\
small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once\
put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always\
prevent us from carrying them out.\'94\
\
\'93Harry, you are dreadful! I don\'92t know why I like you so much.\'94\
\
\'93You will always like me, Dorian,\'94 he replied. \'93Will you have some\
coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and\
some cigarettes. No, don\'92t mind the cigarettes\'97I have some. Basil, I\
can\'92t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette\
is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it\
leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will\
always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never\
had the courage to commit.\'94\
\
\'93What nonsense you talk, Harry!\'94 cried the lad, taking a light from a\
fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.\
\'93Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will\
have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you\
have never known.\'94\
\
\'93I have known everything,\'94 said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his\
eyes, \'93but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,\
that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful\
girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.\
Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but\
there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a\
hansom.\'94\
\
They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The\
painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He\
could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better\
than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,\
they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been\
arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in\
front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that\
Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the\
past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded\
flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the\
theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VII.\
\
\
For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat\
Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with\
an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of\
pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top\
of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he\
had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,\
upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and\
insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud\
to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a\
poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The\
heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a\
monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery\
had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.\
They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges\
with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in\
the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of\
the popping of corks came from the bar.\
\
\'93What a place to find one\'92s divinity in!\'94 said Lord Henry.\
\
\'93Yes!\'94 answered Dorian Gray. \'93It was here I found her, and she is\
divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget\
everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and\
brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They\
sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to\
do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,\
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one\'92s self.\'94\
\
\'93The same flesh and blood as one\'92s self! Oh, I hope not!\'94 exclaimed\
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his\
opera-glass.\
\
\'93Don\'92t pay any attention to him, Dorian,\'94 said the painter. \'93I\
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love\
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must\
be fine and noble. To spiritualize one\'92s age\'97that is something worth\
doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without\
one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have\
been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and\
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of\
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage\
is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The\
gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been\
incomplete.\'94\
\
\'93Thanks, Basil,\'94 answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. \'93I knew that\
you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here\
is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about\
five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom\
I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is\
good in me.\'94\
\
A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of\
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly\
lovely to look at\'97one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,\
that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace\
and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror\
of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded\
enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to\
tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.\
Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord\
Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, \'93Charming! charming!\'94\
\
The scene was the hall of Capulet\'92s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim\'92s\
dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such\
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through\
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a\
creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a\
plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a\
white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.\
\
Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes\
rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak\'97\
\
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\
For saints have hands that pilgrims\'92 hands do touch,\
    And palm to palm is holy palmers\'92 kiss\'97\
\
\
with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly\
artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view\
of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away\
all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.\
\
Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.\
Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them\
to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.\
\
Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of\
the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was\
nothing in her.\
\
She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be\
denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse\
as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She\
overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage\'97\
\
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night\'97\
\
\
was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been\
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she\
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines\'97\
\
Although I joy in thee,\
I have no joy of this contract to-night:\
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\
Ere one can say, \'93It lightens.\'94 Sweet, good-night!\
This bud of love by summer\'92s ripening breath\
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet\'97\
\
\
she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was\
not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely\
self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.\
\
Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their\
interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and\
to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the\
dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was\
the girl herself.\
\
When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord\
Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. \'93She is quite\
beautiful, Dorian,\'94 he said, \'93but she can\'92t act. Let us go.\'94\
\
\'93I am going to see the play through,\'94 answered the lad, in a hard\
bitter voice. \'93I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an\
evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,\'94 interrupted\
Hallward. \'93We will come some other night.\'94\
\
\'93I wish she were ill,\'94 he rejoined. \'93But she seems to me to be simply\
callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great\
artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more\
wonderful thing than art.\'94\
\
\'93They are both simply forms of imitation,\'94 remarked Lord Henry. \'93But do\
let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good\
for one\'92s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don\'92t suppose you will\
want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like\
a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about\
life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.\
There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating\'97people\
who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.\
Good heavens, my dear boy, don\'92t look so tragic! The secret of\
remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to\
the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to\
the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?\'94\
\
\'93Go away, Harry,\'94 cried the lad. \'93I want to be alone. Basil, you must\
go. Ah! can\'92t you see that my heart is breaking?\'94 The hot tears came to\
his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he\
leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.\
\
\'93Let us go, Basil,\'94 said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his\
voice, and the two young men passed out together.\
\
A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose\
on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,\
and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed\
interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots\
and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played\
to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some\
groans.\
\
As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\
greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on\
her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a\
radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of\
their own.\
\
When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy\
came over her. \'93How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!\'94 she cried.\
\
\'93Horribly!\'94 he answered, gazing at her in amazement. \'93Horribly! It was\
dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea\
what I suffered.\'94\
\
The girl smiled. \'93Dorian,\'94 she answered, lingering over his name with\
long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to\
the red petals of her mouth. \'93Dorian, you should have understood. But\
you understand now, don\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93Understand what?\'94 he asked, angrily.\
\
\'93Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall\
never act well again.\'94\
\
He shrugged his shoulders. \'93You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill\
you shouldn\'92t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.\
I was bored.\'94\
\
She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An\
ecstasy of happiness dominated her.\
\
\'93Dorian, Dorian,\'94 she cried, \'93before I knew you, acting was the one\
reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought\
that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.\
The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine\
also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me\
seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew\
nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came\'97oh, my beautiful\
love!\'97and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality\
really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the\
hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had\
always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that\
the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the\
orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I\
had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to\
say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is\
but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My\
love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of\
shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do\
with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not\
understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that\
I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly\
it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to\
me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love\
such as ours? Take me away, Dorian\'97take me away with you, where we can\
be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not\
feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,\
Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it\
would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me\
see that.\'94\
\
He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. \'93You have\
killed my love,\'94 he muttered.\
\
She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came\
across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt\
down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a\
shudder ran through him.\
\
Then he leaped up and went to the door. \'93Yes,\'94 he cried, \'93you have\
killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don\'92t even\
stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because\
you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you\
realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the\
shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and\
stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You\
are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think\
of you. I will never mention your name. You don\'92t know what you were to\
me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can\'92t bear to think of it! I wish I had\
never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How\
little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your\
art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,\
magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have\
borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty\
face.\'94\
\
The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and\
her voice seemed to catch in her throat. \'93You are not serious, Dorian?\'94\
she murmured. \'93You are acting.\'94\
\
\'93Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,\'94 he answered bitterly.\
\
She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her\
face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and\
looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. \'93Don\'92t touch me!\'94 he cried.\
\
A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay\
there like a trampled flower. \'93Dorian, Dorian, don\'92t leave me!\'94 she\
whispered. \'93I am so sorry I didn\'92t act well. I was thinking of you all\
the time. But I will try\'97indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across\
me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had\
not kissed me\'97if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.\
Don\'92t go away from me. I couldn\'92t bear it. Oh! don\'92t go away from me.\
My brother ... No; never mind. He didn\'92t mean it. He was in jest....\
But you, oh! can\'92t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and\
try to improve. Don\'92t be cruel to me, because I love you better than\
anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not\
pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown\
myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn\'92t help\
it. Oh, don\'92t leave me, don\'92t leave me.\'94 A fit of passionate sobbing\
choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian\
Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled\
lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous\
about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane\
seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed\
him.\
\
\'93I am going,\'94 he said at last in his calm clear voice. \'93I don\'92t wish to\
be unkind, but I can\'92t see you again. You have disappointed me.\'94\
\
She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little\
hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He\
turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of\
the theatre.\
\
Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly\
lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking\
houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after\
him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like\
monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,\
and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.\
\
As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.\
The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed\
itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies\
rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with\
the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an\
anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men\
unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some\
cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money\
for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at\
midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long\
line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red\
roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,\
jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,\
sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\
waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging\
doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped\
and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.\
Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked\
and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\
\
After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few\
moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent\
square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.\
The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like\
silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke\
was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.\
\
In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge\'92s barge, that\
hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,\
lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals\
of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,\
having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library\
towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the\
ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had\
decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries\
that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As\
he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait\
Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.\
Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he\
had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.\
Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In\
the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk\
blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression\
looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty\
in the mouth. It was certainly strange.\
\
He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The\
bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky\
corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he\
had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be\
more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the\
lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking\
into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\
\
He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory\
Cupids, one of Lord Henry\'92s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly\
into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What\
did it mean?\
\
He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\
again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual\
painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had\
altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly\
apparent.\
\
He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there\
flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward\'92s studio the\
day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He\
had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the\
portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the\
face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that\
the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and\
thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness\
of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been\
fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to\
think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the\
touch of cruelty in the mouth.\
\
Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl\'92s fault, not his. He had\
dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he\
had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been\
shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over\
him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little\
child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had\
he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he\
had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had\
lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His\
life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had\
wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear\
sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of\
their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one\
with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and\
Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl\
Vane? She was nothing to him now.\
\
But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his\
life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.\
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it\
again?\
\
No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The\
horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly\
there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men\
mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.\
\
Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\
smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met\
his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted\
image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would\
alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses\
would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and\
wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or\
unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would\
resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more\'97would not, at\
any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil\
Hallward\'92s garden had first stirred within him the passion for\
impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,\
marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She\
must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish\
and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would\
return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be\
beautiful and pure.\
\
He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the\
portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. \'93How horrible!\'94 he murmured\
to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he\
stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning\
air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of\
Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name\
over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched\
garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VIII.\
\
\
It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times\
on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered\
what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and\
Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a\
small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,\
with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall\
windows.\
\
\'93Monsieur has well slept this morning,\'94 he said, smiling.\
\
\'93What o\'92clock is it, Victor?\'94 asked Dorian Gray drowsily.\
\
\'93One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.\'94\
\
How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his\
letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand\
that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The\
others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of\
cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of\
charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young\
men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for\
a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the\
courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned\
people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary\
things are our only necessities; and there were several very\
courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders\
offering to advance any sum of money at a moment\'92s notice and at the\
most reasonable rates of interest.\
\
After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate\
dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the\
onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.\
He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense\
of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,\
but there was the unreality of a dream about it.\
\
As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a\
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round\
table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air\
seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the\
blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before\
him. He felt perfectly happy.\
\
Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the\
portrait, and he started.\
\
\'93Too cold for Monsieur?\'94 asked his valet, putting an omelette on the\
table. \'93I shut the window?\'94\
\
Dorian shook his head. \'93I am not cold,\'94 he murmured.\
\
Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply\
his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there\
had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The\
thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It\
would make him smile.\
\
And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in\
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of\
cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the\
room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the\
portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes\
had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to\
tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him\
back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a\
moment. \'93I am not at home to any one, Victor,\'94 he said with a sigh. The\
man bowed and retired.\
\
Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on\
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen\
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a\
rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,\
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man\'92s life.\
\
Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was\
the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was\
not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier\
chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?\
What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own\
picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be\
examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful\
state of doubt.\
\
He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he\
looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and\
saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had\
altered.\
\
As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he\
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost\
scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was\
incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle\
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form\
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be\
that what that soul thought, they realized?\'97that what it dreamed, they\
made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,\
and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the\
picture in sickened horror.\
\
One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him\
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not\
too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His\
unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be\
transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil\
Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would\
be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the\
fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could\
lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the\
degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men\
brought upon their souls.\
\
Three o\'92clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double\
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the\
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his\
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was\
wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he\
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had\
loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He\
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of\
pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we\
feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,\
not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the\
letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.\
\
Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry\'92s\
voice outside. \'93My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can\'92t\
bear your shutting yourself up like this.\'94\
\
He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking\
still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry\
in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel\
with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was\
inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,\
and unlocked the door.\
\
\'93I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,\'94 said Lord Henry as he entered. \'93But\
you must not think too much about it.\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?\'94 asked the lad.\
\
\'93Yes, of course,\'94 answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly\
pulling off his yellow gloves. \'93It is dreadful, from one point of view,\
but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,\
after the play was over?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?\'94\
\
\'93I was brutal, Harry\'97perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am\
not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know\
myself better.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would\
find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.\'94\
\
\'93I have got through all that,\'94 said Dorian, shaking his head and\
smiling. \'93I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin\
with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in\
us. Don\'92t sneer at it, Harry, any more\'97at least not before me. I want\
to be good. I can\'92t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.\'94\
\
\'93A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you\
on it. But how are you going to begin?\'94\
\
\'93By marrying Sibyl Vane.\'94\
\
\'93Marrying Sibyl Vane!\'94 cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him\
in perplexed amazement. \'93But, my dear Dorian\'97\'94\
\
\'93Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about\
marriage. Don\'92t say it. Don\'92t ever say things of that kind to me again.\
Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word\
to her. She is to be my wife.\'94\
\
\'93Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn\'92t you get my letter? I wrote to you this\
morning, and sent the note down by my own man.\'94\
\
\'93Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was\
afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn\'92t like. You cut\
life to pieces with your epigrams.\'94\
\
\'93You know nothing then?\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94\
\
Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,\
took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. \'93Dorian,\'94 he\
said, \'93my letter\'97don\'92t be frightened\'97was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is\
dead.\'94\
\
A cry of pain broke from the lad\'92s lips, and he leaped to his feet,\
tearing his hands away from Lord Henry\'92s grasp. \'93Dead! Sibyl dead! It\
is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?\'94\
\
\'93It is quite true, Dorian,\'94 said Lord Henry, gravely. \'93It is in all the\
morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till\
I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not\
be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.\
But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make\
one\'92s _d\'e9but_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an\
interest to one\'92s old age. I suppose they don\'92t know your name at the\
theatre? If they don\'92t, it is all right. Did any one see you going\
round to her room? That is an important point.\'94\
\
Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.\
Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, \'93Harry, did you say an\
inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl\'97? Oh, Harry, I can\'92t bear\
it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.\'94\
\
\'93I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put\
in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre\
with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had\
forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she\
did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the\
floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,\
some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don\'92t know what it was, but\
it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was\
prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.\'94\
\
\'93Harry, Harry, it is terrible!\'94 cried the lad.\
\
\'93Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed\
up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have\
thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and\
seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn\'92t let this\
thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and\
afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and\
everybody will be there. You can come to my sister\'92s box. She has got\
some smart women with her.\'94\
\
\'93So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,\'94 said Dorian Gray, half to himself,\
\'93murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.\
Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as\
happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go\
on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How\
extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,\
Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has\
happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.\
Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my\
life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been\
addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent\
people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,\
Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was\
everything to me. Then came that dreadful night\'97was it really only last\
night?\'97when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She\
explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a\
bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me\
afraid. I can\'92t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I\
would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My\
God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don\'92t know the danger I am in,\
and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for\
me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Dorian,\'94 answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case\
and producing a gold-latten matchbox, \'93the only way a woman can ever\
reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible\
interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been\
wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always\
be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon\
found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman\
finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,\
or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman\'92s husband has to pay\
for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been\
abject\'97which, of course, I would not have allowed\'97but I assure you that\
in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.\'94\
\
\'93I suppose it would,\'94 muttered the lad, walking up and down the room\
and looking horribly pale. \'93But I thought it was my duty. It is not my\
fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.\
I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good\
resolutions\'97that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.\'94\
\
\'93Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific\
laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.\
They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions\
that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said\
for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they\
have no account.\'94\
\
\'93Harry,\'94 cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,\
\'93why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I\
don\'92t think I am heartless. Do you?\'94\
\
\'93You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be\
entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,\'94 answered Lord Henry with\
his sweet melancholy smile.\
\
The lad frowned. \'93I don\'92t like that explanation, Harry,\'94 he rejoined,\
\'93but I am glad you don\'92t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the\
kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has\
happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply\
like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible\
beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but\
by which I have not been wounded.\'94\
\
\'93It is an interesting question,\'94 said Lord Henry, who found an\
exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad\'92s unconscious egotism, \'93an\
extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is\
this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an\
inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their\
absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack\
of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an\
impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,\
however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses\
our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply\
appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are\
no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are\
both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle\
enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?\
Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had\
such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the\
rest of my life. The people who have adored me\'97there have not been very\
many, but there have been some\'97have always insisted on living on, long\
after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have\
become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for\
reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!\
And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb\
the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details\
are always vulgar.\'94\
\
\'93I must sow poppies in my garden,\'94 sighed Dorian.\
\
\'93There is no necessity,\'94 rejoined his companion. \'93Life has always\
poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once\
wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic\
mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did\
die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice\
the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one\
with the terror of eternity. Well\'97would you believe it?\'97a week ago, at\
Lady Hampshire\'92s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in\
question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and\
digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance\
in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I\
had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous\
dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she\
showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women\
never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,\
and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose\
to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would\
have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.\
They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are\
more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the\
women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.\
Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going\
in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,\
whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of\
pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a\
great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their\
husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one\'92s face, as if it\
were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its\
mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and\
I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being\
told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;\
there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern\
life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.\'94\
\
\'93What is that, Harry?\'94 said the lad listlessly.\
\
\'93Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else\'92s admirer when one\
loses one\'92s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But\
really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the\
women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her\
death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.\
They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,\
such as romance, passion, and love.\'94\
\
\'93I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.\'94\
\
\'93I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more\
than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have\
emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all\
the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I\
have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how\
delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day\
before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,\
but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to\
everything.\'94\
\
\'93What was that, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of\
romance\'97that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that\
if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.\'94\
\
\'93She will never come to life again now,\'94 muttered the lad, burying his\
face in his hands.\
\
\'93No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you\
must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a\
strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene\
from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,\
and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a\
dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare\'92s plays and left them\
lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare\'92s music\
sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual\
life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn\
for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was\
strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio\
died. But don\'92t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real\
than they are.\'94\
\
There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and\
with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours\
faded wearily out of things.\
\
After some time Dorian Gray looked up. \'93You have explained me to\
myself, Harry,\'94 he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. \'93I felt\
all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not\
express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again\
of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.\
I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.\'94\
\
\'93Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that\
you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.\'94\
\
\'93But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What\
then?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, then,\'94 said Lord Henry, rising to go, \'93then, my dear Dorian, you\
would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to\
you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads\
too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We\
cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the\
club. We are rather late, as it is.\'94\
\
\'93I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat\
anything. What is the number of your sister\'92s box?\'94\
\
\'93Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her\
name on the door. But I am sorry you won\'92t come and dine.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t feel up to it,\'94 said Dorian listlessly. \'93But I am awfully\
obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my\
best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.\'94\
\
\'93We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,\'94 answered Lord\
Henry, shaking him by the hand. \'93Good-bye. I shall see you before\
nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.\'94\
\
As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in\
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.\
He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an\
interminable time over everything.\
\
As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;\
there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of\
Sibyl Vane\'92s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious\
of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred\
the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment\
that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it\
indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed\
within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the\
change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.\
\
Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked\
death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her\
with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed\
him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would\
always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the\
sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what\
she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.\
When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent\
on to the world\'92s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A\
wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her\
childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He\
brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.\
\
He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his\
choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him\'97life, and\
his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,\
pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins\'97he was to have\
all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:\
that was all.\
\
A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that\
was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery\
of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips\
that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat\
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as\
it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which\
he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be\
hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had\
so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The\
pity of it! the pity of it!\
\
For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that\
existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in\
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain\
unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender\
the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance\
might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?\
Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer\
that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious\
scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence\
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon\
dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,\
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods\
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?\
But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a\
prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to\
alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?\
\
For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to\
follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him\
the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so\
it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he\
would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.\
When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of\
chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one\
blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life\
would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and\
fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured\
image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.\
\
He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,\
smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was\
already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord\
Henry was leaning over his chair.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX.\
\
\
As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown\
into the room.\
\
\'93I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,\'94 he said gravely. \'93I called\
last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew\
that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really\
gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy\
might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me\
when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late\
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at\
once and was miserable at not finding you. I can\'92t tell you how\
heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.\
But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl\'92s mother? For a\
moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the\
paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn\'92t it? But I was afraid of\
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a\
state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about\
it all?\'94\
\
\'93My dear Basil, how do I know?\'94 murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some\
pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass\
and looking dreadfully bored. \'93I was at the opera. You should have come\
on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry\'92s sister, for the first time. We\
were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.\
Don\'92t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn\'92t talk about a thing, it\
has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives\
reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman\'92s only\
child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on\
the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about\
yourself and what you are painting.\'94\
\
\'93You went to the opera?\'94 said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a\
strained touch of pain in his voice. \'93You went to the opera while Sibyl\
Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other\
women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl\
you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there\
are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!\'94\
\
\'93Stop, Basil! I won\'92t hear it!\'94 cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. \'93You\
must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is\
past.\'94\
\
\'93You call yesterday the past?\'94\
\
\'93What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only\
shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is\
master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a\
pleasure. I don\'92t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use\
them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.\'94\
\
\'93Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You\
look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come\
down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,\
and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the\
whole world. Now, I don\'92t know what has come over you. You talk as if\
you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry\'92s influence. I see\
that.\'94\
\
The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few\
moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. \'93I owe a great\
deal to Harry, Basil,\'94 he said at last, \'93more than I owe to you. You\
only taught me to be vain.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I am punished for that, Dorian\'97or shall be some day.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know what you mean, Basil,\'94 he exclaimed, turning round. \'93I\
don\'92t know what you want. What do you want?\'94\
\
\'93I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,\'94 said the artist sadly.\
\
\'93Basil,\'94 said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his\
shoulder, \'93you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl\
Vane had killed herself\'97\'94\
\
\'93Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?\'94 cried\
Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.\
\
\'93My dear Basil! Surely you don\'92t think it was a vulgar accident? Of\
course she killed herself.\'94\
\
The elder man buried his face in his hands. \'93How fearful,\'94 he muttered,\
and a shudder ran through him.\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Dorian Gray, \'93there is nothing fearful about it. It is one\
of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act\
lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful\
wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean\'97middle-class virtue\
and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her\
finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played\'97the\
night you saw her\'97she acted badly because she had known the reality of\
love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.\
She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the\
martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of\
martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not\
think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular\
moment\'97about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six\'97you would\
have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the\
news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered\
immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,\
except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come\
down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,\
and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a\
story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty\
years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some\
unjust law altered\'97I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,\
and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing\
to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And\
besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me\
rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic\
point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la\
consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered\
book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.\
Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at\
Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could\
console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that\
one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work,\
carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp\'97there is much to\
be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,\
or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of\
one\'92s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I\
know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not\
realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am\
a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am\
different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must\
always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know\
that you are better than he is. You are not stronger\'97you are too much\
afraid of life\'97but you are better. And how happy we used to be\
together! Don\'92t leave me, Basil, and don\'92t quarrel with me. I am what I\
am. There is nothing more to be said.\'94\
\
The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,\
and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He\
could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his\
indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was\
so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.\
\
\'93Well, Dorian,\'94 he said at length, with a sad smile, \'93I won\'92t speak to\
you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your\
name won\'92t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take\
place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?\'94\
\
Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at\
the mention of the word \'93inquest.\'94 There was something so crude and\
vulgar about everything of the kind. \'93They don\'92t know my name,\'94 he\
answered.\
\
\'93But surely she did?\'94\
\
\'93Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned\
to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn\
who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince\
Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,\
Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a\
few kisses and some broken pathetic words.\'94\
\
\'93I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you\
must come and sit to me yourself again. I can\'92t get on without you.\'94\
\
\'93I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!\'94 he exclaimed,\
starting back.\
\
The painter stared at him. \'93My dear boy, what nonsense!\'94 he cried. \'93Do\
you mean to say you don\'92t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have\
you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best\
thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply\
disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room\
looked different as I came in.\'94\
\
\'93My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don\'92t imagine I let\
him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes\'97that\
is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.\'94\
\
\'93Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for\
it. Let me see it.\'94 And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.\
\
A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray\'92s lips, and he rushed between\
the painter and the screen. \'93Basil,\'94 he said, looking very pale, \'93you\
must not look at it. I don\'92t wish you to.\'94\
\
\'93Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn\'92t I look at\
it?\'94 exclaimed Hallward, laughing.\
\
\'93If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never\
speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don\'92t offer\
any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you\
touch this screen, everything is over between us.\'94\
\
Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute\
amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually\
pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes\
were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.\
\
\'93Dorian!\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t speak!\'94\
\
\'93But what is the matter? Of course I won\'92t look at it if you don\'92t want\
me to,\'94 he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over\
towards the window. \'93But, really, it seems rather absurd that I\
shouldn\'92t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in\
Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of\
varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?\'94\
\
\'93To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?\'94 exclaimed Dorian Gray, a\
strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be\
shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That\
was impossible. Something\'97he did not know what\'97had to be done at once.\
\
\'93Yes; I don\'92t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going\
to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de\
S\'e8ze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only\
be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that\
time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it\
always behind a screen, you can\'92t care much about it.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of\
perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible\
danger. \'93You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,\'94 he\
cried. \'93Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being\
consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference\
is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can\'92t have forgotten\
that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would\
induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the\
same thing.\'94 He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his\
eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half\
seriously and half in jest, \'93If you want to have a strange quarter of\
an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won\'92t exhibit your picture. He\
told me why he wouldn\'92t, and it was a revelation to me.\'94 Yes, perhaps\
Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.\
\
\'93Basil,\'94 he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in\
the face, \'93we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall\
tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my\
picture?\'94\
\
The painter shuddered in spite of himself. \'93Dorian, if I told you, you\
might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I\
could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me\
never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to\
look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from\
the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any\
fame or reputation.\'94\
\
\'93No, Basil, you must tell me,\'94 insisted Dorian Gray. \'93I think I have a\
right to know.\'94 His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity\
had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward\'92s\
mystery.\
\
\'93Let us sit down, Dorian,\'94 said the painter, looking troubled. \'93Let us\
sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the\
picture something curious?\'97something that probably at first did not\
strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?\'94\
\
\'93Basil!\'94 cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling\
hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.\
\
\'93I see you did. Don\'92t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.\
Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most\
extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and\
power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen\
ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I\
worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted\
to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When\
you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,\
I never let you know anything about this. It would have been\
impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it\
myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that\
the world had become wonderful to my eyes\'97too wonderful, perhaps, for\
in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less\
than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew\
more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn\
you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman\'92s cloak and\
polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on\
the prow of Adrian\'92s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You\
had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the\
water\'92s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been\
what art should be\'97unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day\
I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as\
you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own\
dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,\
or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to\
me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at\
it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I\
grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that\
I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it\
was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You\
were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant\
to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not\
mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I\
felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my\
studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of\
its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that\
I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely\
good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling\
that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is\
ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract\
than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour\'97that is all.\
It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely\
than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I\
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.\
It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were\
right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,\
Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are\
made to be worshipped.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and\
a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the\
time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who\
had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he\
himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord\
Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was\
too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be\
some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of\
the things that life had in store?\
\
\'93It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,\'94 said Hallward, \'93that you should\
have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?\'94\
\
\'93I saw something in it,\'94 he answered, \'93something that seemed to me very\
curious.\'94\
\
\'93Well, you don\'92t mind my looking at the thing now?\'94\
\
Dorian shook his head. \'93You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not\
possibly let you stand in front of that picture.\'94\
\
\'93You will some day, surely?\'94\
\
\'93Never.\'94\
\
\'93Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been\
the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I\
have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don\'92t know what it cost\
me to tell you all that I have told you.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Basil,\'94 said Dorian, \'93what have you told me? Simply that you\
felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.\'94\
\
\'93It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I\
have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one\
should never put one\'92s worship into words.\'94\
\
\'93It was a very disappointing confession.\'94\
\
\'93Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn\'92t see anything else in the\
picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?\'94\
\
\'93No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn\'92t\
talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we\
must always remain so.\'94\
\
\'93You have got Harry,\'94 said the painter sadly.\
\
\'93Oh, Harry!\'94 cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. \'93Harry spends\
his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is\
improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I\
don\'92t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go\
to you, Basil.\'94\
\
\'93You will sit to me again?\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94\
\
\'93You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes\
across two ideal things. Few come across one.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.\
There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I\
will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.\'94\
\
\'93Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,\'94 murmured Hallward regretfully. \'93And\
now good-bye. I am sorry you won\'92t let me look at the picture once\
again. But that can\'92t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about\
it.\'94\
\
As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How\
little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead\
of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,\
almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that\
strange confession explained to him! The painter\'92s absurd fits of\
jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious\
reticences\'97he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed\
to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.\
\
He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all\
costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad\
of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room\
to which any of his friends had access.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X.\
\
\
When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if\
he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite\
impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked\
over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of\
Victor\'92s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There\
was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his\
guard.\
\
Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he\
wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to\
send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man\
left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was\
that merely his own fancy?\
\
After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread\
mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He\
asked her for the key of the schoolroom.\
\
\'93The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?\'94 she exclaimed. \'93Why, it is full of\
dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It\
is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir, you\'92ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it\
hasn\'92t been opened for nearly five years\'97not since his lordship died.\'94\
\
He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of\
him. \'93That does not matter,\'94 he answered. \'93I simply want to see the\
place\'97that is all. Give me the key.\'94\
\
\'93And here is the key, sir,\'94 said the old lady, going over the contents\
of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. \'93Here is the key. I\'92ll\
have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don\'92t think of living up\
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94 he cried petulantly. \'93Thank you, Leaf. That will do.\'94\
\
She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of\
the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought\
best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.\
\
As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round\
the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily\
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century\
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.\
Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps\
served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that\
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death\
itself\'97something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What\
the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on\
the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They\
would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still\
live on. It would be always alive.\
\
He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil\
the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would\
have helped him to resist Lord Henry\'92s influence, and the still more\
poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that\
he bore him\'97for it was really love\'97had nothing in it that was not noble\
and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty\
that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was\
such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,\
and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was\
too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or\
forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were\
passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that\
would make the shadow of their evil real.\
\
He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that\
covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was\
the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was\
unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue\
eyes, and rose-red lips\'97they all were there. It was simply the\
expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared\
to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil\'92s\
reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!\'97how shallow, and of what little\
account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and\
calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung\
the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.\
He passed out as his servant entered.\
\
\'93The persons are here, Monsieur.\'94\
\
He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed\
to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly\
about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the\
writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him\
round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at\
eight-fifteen that evening.\
\
\'93Wait for an answer,\'94 he said, handing it to him, \'93and show the men in\
here.\'94\
\
In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard\
himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in\
with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a\
florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was\
considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the\
artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He\
waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in\
favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed\
everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.\
\
\'93What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?\'94 he said, rubbing his fat freckled\
hands. \'93I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in\
person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a\
sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited\
for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.\'94\
\
\'93I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.\
Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame\'97though I don\'92t\
go in much at present for religious art\'97but to-day I only want a\
picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so\
I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.\'94\
\
\'93No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to\
you. Which is the work of art, sir?\'94\
\
\'93This,\'94 replied Dorian, moving the screen back. \'93Can you move it,\
covering and all, just as it is? I don\'92t want it to get scratched going\
upstairs.\'94\
\
\'93There will be no difficulty, sir,\'94 said the genial frame-maker,\
beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from\
the long brass chains by which it was suspended. \'93And, now, where shall\
we carry it to, Mr. Gray?\'94\
\
\'93I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or\
perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top\
of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.\'94\
\
He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and\
began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the\
picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious\
protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman\'92s spirited dislike\
of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it\
so as to help them.\
\
\'93Something of a load to carry, sir,\'94 gasped the little man when they\
reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.\
\
\'93I am afraid it is rather heavy,\'94 murmured Dorian as he unlocked the\
door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious\
secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.\
\
He had not entered the place for more than four years\'97not, indeed,\
since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then\
as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,\
well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord\
Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness\
to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and\
desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little\
changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically\
painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so\
often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled\
with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the\
same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing\
chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded\
birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every\
moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He\
recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed\
horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden\
away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in\
store for him!\
\
But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as\
this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its\
purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,\
and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would\
not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He\
kept his youth\'97that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow\
finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full\
of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and\
shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit\
and in flesh\'97those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them\
their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would\
have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to\
the world Basil Hallward\'92s masterpiece.\
\
No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon\
the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but\
the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become\
hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow\'92s feet would creep round the fading eyes\
and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth\
would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old\
men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined\
hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had\
been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.\
There was no help for it.\
\
\'93Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,\'94 he said, wearily, turning round. \'93I\
am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.\'94\
\
\'93Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,\'94 answered the frame-maker, who\
was still gasping for breath. \'93Where shall we put it, sir?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don\'92t want to have it hung up.\
Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.\'94\
\
\'93Might one look at the work of art, sir?\'94\
\
Dorian started. \'93It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,\'94 he said,\
keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling\
him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that\
concealed the secret of his life. \'93I shan\'92t trouble you any more now. I\
am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.\'94\
\
\'93Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,\
sir.\'94 And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,\
who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough\
uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.\
\
When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door\
and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look\
upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.\
\
On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o\'92clock\
and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark\
perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,\
his guardian\'92s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the\
preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside\
it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the\
edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James\'92s Gazette_\
had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had\
returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were\
leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.\
He would be sure to miss the picture\'97had no doubt missed it already,\
while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set\
back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he\
might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the\
room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one\'92s house. He had\
heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some\
servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked\
up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower\
or a shred of crumpled lace.\
\
He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry\'92s\
note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,\
and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at\
eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James\'92s_ languidly, and looked\
through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew\
attention to the following paragraph:\
\
INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.\'97An inquest was held this morning at the Bell\
Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of\
Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,\
Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable\
sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly\
affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.\
Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.\
\
\
He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and\
flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real\
ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for\
having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have\
marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more\
than enough English for that.\
\
Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,\
what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane\'92s death?\
There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.\
\
His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was\
it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal\
stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange\
Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung\
himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a\
few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had\
ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the\
delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb\
show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made\
real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually\
revealed.\
\
It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,\
indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who\
spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the\
passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his\
own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through\
which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere\
artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,\
as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The\
style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid\
and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical\
expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work\
of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.\
There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in\
colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical\
philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the\
spiritual ecstasies of some medi\'e6val saint or the morbid confessions of\
a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense\
seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere\
cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full\
as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,\
produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,\
a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of\
the falling day and creeping shadows.\
\
Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed\
through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no\
more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the\
lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed\
the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his\
bedside and began to dress for dinner.\
\
It was almost nine o\'92clock before he reached the club, where he found\
Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.\
\
\'93I am so sorry, Harry,\'94 he cried, \'93but really it is entirely your\
fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the\
time was going.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I thought you would like it,\'94 replied his host, rising from his\
chair.\
\
\'93I didn\'92t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a\
great difference.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, you have discovered that?\'94 murmured Lord Henry. And they passed\
into the dining-room.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI.\
\
\
For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of\
this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never\
sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than\
nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in\
different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the\
changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have\
almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in\
whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely\
blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,\
indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own\
life, written before he had lived it.\
\
In one point he was more fortunate than the novel\'92s fantastic hero. He\
never knew\'97never, indeed, had any cause to know\'97that somewhat grotesque\
dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which\
came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned\
by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so\
remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy\'97and perhaps in nearly every\
joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place\'97that he used\
to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if\
somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who\
had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly\
valued.\
\
For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and\
many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had\
heard the most evil things against him\'97and from time to time strange\
rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the\
chatter of the clubs\'97could not believe anything to his dishonour when\
they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself\
unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when\
Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his\
face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the\
memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one\
so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an\
age that was at once sordid and sensual.\
\
Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged\
absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were\
his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep\
upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left\
him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil\
Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on\
the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him\
from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to\
quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his\
own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.\
He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and\
terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead\
or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which\
were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would\
place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,\
and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.\
\
There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own\
delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little\
ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in\
disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he\
had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant\
because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.\
That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as\
they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase\
with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He\
had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.\
\
Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to\
society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each\
Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the\
world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the\
day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little\
dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were\
noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,\
as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with\
its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered\
cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,\
especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,\
in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often\
dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of\
the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and\
perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of\
the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to \'93make\
themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.\'94 Like Gautier, he was one\
for whom \'93the visible world existed.\'94\
\
And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the\
arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.\
Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment\
universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert\
the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for\
him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to\
time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of\
the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in\
everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of\
his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.\
\
For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost\
immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a\
subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the\
London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the\
Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be\
something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on\
the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of\
a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have\
its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the\
spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.\
\
The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been\
decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and\
sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are\
conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.\
But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had\
never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal\
merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or\
to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a\
new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the\
dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through\
history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been\
surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful\
rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose\
origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more\
terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,\
they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out\
the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to\
the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.\
\
Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that\
was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism\
that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its\
service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any\
theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of\
passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,\
and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of\
the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy\
that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to\
concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a\
moment.\
\
There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either\
after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of\
death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through\
the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality\
itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,\
and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one\
might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled\
with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the\
curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb\
shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,\
there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men\
going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down\
from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it\
feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from\
her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by\
degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we\
watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan\
mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we\
had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been\
studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the\
letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.\
Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night\
comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where\
we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the\
necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of\
stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids\
might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in\
the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh\
shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in\
which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,\
in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of\
joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.\
\
It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray\
to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his\
search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and\
possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he\
would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really\
alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and\
then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his\
intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that\
is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,\
indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition\
of it.\
\
It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman\
Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great\
attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the\
sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb\
rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity\
of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it\
sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement\
and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with\
white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft\
the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at\
times, one would fain think, is indeed the \'93_panis c\'e6lestis_,\'94 the\
bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,\
breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.\
The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,\
tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle\
fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at\
the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of\
them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating\
the true story of their lives.\
\
But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual\
development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of\
mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable\
for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which\
there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its\
marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle\
antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a\
season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of\
the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in\
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the\
brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of\
the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,\
morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him\
before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance\
compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all\
intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.\
He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual\
mysteries to reveal.\
\
And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their\
manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums\
from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not\
its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their\
true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one\
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one\'92s passions, and in violets\
that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the\
brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often\
to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several\
influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;\
of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that\
sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to\
be able to expel melancholy from the soul.\
\
At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long\
latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of\
olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad\
gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled\
Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while\
grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching\
upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of\
reed or brass and charmed\'97or feigned to charm\'97great hooded snakes and\
horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of\
barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert\'92s grace, and Chopin\'92s\
beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell\
unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world\
the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of\
dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact\
with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the\
mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not\
allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been\
subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the\
Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human\
bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green\
jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular\
sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when\
they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the\
performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the\
harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who\
sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a\
distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating\
tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an\
elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells\
of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge\
cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the\
one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican\
temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a\
description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated\
him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like\
Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous\
voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his\
box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt\
pleasure to \'93Tannhauser\'94 and seeing in the prelude to that great work\
of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.\
\
On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a\
costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered\
with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for\
years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often\
spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various\
stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that\
turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,\
the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,\
carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red\
cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their\
alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the\
sunstone, and the moonstone\'92s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow\
of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of\
extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la\
vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.\
\
He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso\'92s\
Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real\
jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of\
Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes \'93with\
collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.\'94 There was a gem in\
the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and \'93by the exhibition\
of golden letters and a scarlet robe\'94 the monster could be thrown into\
a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de\
Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India\
made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth\
provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The\
garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her\
colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,\
that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.\
Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a\
newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The\
bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm\
that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the\
aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any\
danger by fire.\
\
The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,\
as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the\
Priest were \'93made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake\
inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.\'94 Over the gable\
were \'93two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,\'94 so that the\
gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge\'92s strange\
romance \'91A Margarite of America\'92, it was stated that in the chamber of\
the queen one could behold \'93all the chaste ladies of the world,\
inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,\
carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.\'94 Marco Polo had seen the\
inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the\
dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver\
brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven\
moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,\
he flung it away\'97Procopius tells the story\'97nor was it ever found again,\
though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold\
pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a\
rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he\
worshipped.\
\
When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.\
of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to\
Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great\
light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred\
and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty\
thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described\
Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as\
wearing \'93a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds\
and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large\
balasses.\'94 The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in\
gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold\
armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with\
turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parsem\'e9_ with pearls. Henry II. wore\
jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with\
twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the\
Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped\
pearls and studded with sapphires.\
\
How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and\
decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.\
\
Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that\
performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern\
nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject\'97and he always had an\
extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in\
whatever he took up\'97he was almost saddened by the reflection of the\
ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any\
rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils\
bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of\
their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained\
his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where\
had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which\
the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls\
for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had\
stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on\
which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot\
drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious\
table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were\
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;\
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden\
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of\
Pontus and were figured with \'93lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,\
rocks, hunters\'97all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature\'94; and\
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which\
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning \'93_Madame, je suis tout\
joyeux_,\'94 the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold\
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four\
pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims\
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with \'93thirteen\
hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the\
king\'92s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings\
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked\
in gold.\'94 Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black\
velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,\
with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,\
and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in\
a room hung with rows of the queen\'92s devices in cut black velvet upon\
cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen\
feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,\
was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses\
from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,\
and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been\
taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed\
had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.\
\
And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite\
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting\
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and\
stitched over with iridescent beetles\'92 wings; the Dacca gauzes, that\
from their transparency are known in the East as \'93woven air,\'94 and\
\'93running water,\'94 and \'93evening dew\'94; strange figured cloths from Java;\
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair\
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of\
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish\
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,\
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.\
\
He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed\
he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the\
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had\
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the\
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and\
fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by\
the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He\
possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,\
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in\
six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the\
pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided\
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the\
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.\
This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of\
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,\
from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which\
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse\
bore a seraph\'92s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were\
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with\
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He\
had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold\
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with\
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and\
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of\
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins\
and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;\
and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices\
to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his\
imagination.\
\
For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely\
house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he\
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times\
to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked\
room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his\
own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the\
real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the\
purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,\
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,\
his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.\
Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to\
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,\
until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the\
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,\
with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,\
and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to\
bear the burden that should have been his own.\
\
After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and\
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as\
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more\
than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture\
that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his\
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the\
elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.\
\
He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true\
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness\
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn\
from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not\
painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?\
Even if he told them, would they believe it?\
\
Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in\
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank\
who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton\
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly\
leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not\
been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it\
should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely\
the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already\
suspected it.\
\
For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.\
He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth\
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was\
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the\
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another\
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories\
became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It\
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a\
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with\
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His\
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear\
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass\
him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though\
they were determined to discover his secret.\
\
Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,\
and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his\
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth\
that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer\
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about\
him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most\
intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had\
wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and\
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or\
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.\
\
Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his\
strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of\
security. Society\'97civilized society, at least\'97is never very ready to\
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and\
fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance\
than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much\
less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is\
a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad\
dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the\
cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entr\'e9es_, as Lord Henry\
remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a\
good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,\
or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely\
essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as\
its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic\
play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is\
insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method\
by which we can multiply our personalities.\
\
Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray\'92s opinion. He used to wonder at the\
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing\
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a\
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform\
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and\
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies\
of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery\
of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose\
blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by\
Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and\
King James, as one who was \'93caressed by the Court for his handsome\
face, which kept him not long company.\'94 Was it young Herbert\'92s life\
that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body\
to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that\
ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,\
give utterance, in Basil Hallward\'92s studio, to the mad prayer that had\
so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled\
surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,\
with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man\'92s\
legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some\
inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams\
that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading\
canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl\
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,\
and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On\
a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green\
rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the\
strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of\
her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look\
curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and\
fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and\
swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.\
Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so\
overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,\
and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord\
Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and\
one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How\
proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!\
What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as\
infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the\
Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his\
wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred\
within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady\
Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips\'97he knew what he had got\
from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the\
beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.\
There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she\
was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes\
were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They\
seemed to follow him wherever he went.\
\
Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one\'92s own race,\
nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly\
with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There\
were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history\
was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act\
and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it\
had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known\
them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the\
stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of\
subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had\
been his own.\
\
The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had\
himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,\
crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as\
Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of\
Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the\
flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had\
caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in\
an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had\
wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round\
with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his\
days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _t\'e6dium vit\'e6_, that comes\
on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear\
emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of\
pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the\
Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero\
Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with\
colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon\
from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.\
\
Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the\
two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious\
tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and\
beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made\
monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted\
her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the\
dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the\
Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and\
whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the\
price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase\
living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot\
who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide\
riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;\
Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and\
minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,\
and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson\
silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might\
serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy\
could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion\
for red blood, as other men have for red wine\'97the son of the Fiend, as\
was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling\
with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the\
name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads\
was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of\
Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the\
enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave\
poison to Ginevra d\'92Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a\
shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles\
VI., who had so wildly adored his brother\'92s wife that a leper had\
warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his\
brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen\
cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in\
his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto\
Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,\
and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow\
piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,\
and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.\
\
There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and\
they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of\
strange manners of poisoning\'97poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,\
by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by\
an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were\
moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could\
realize his conception of the beautiful.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII.\
\
\
It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth\
birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.\
\
He was walking home about eleven o\'92clock from Lord Henry\'92s, where he\
had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold\
and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a\
man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of\
his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized\
him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could\
not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on\
quickly in the direction of his own house.\
\
But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the\
pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on\
his arm.\
\
\'93Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for\
you in your library ever since nine o\'92clock. Finally I took pity on\
your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am\
off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see\
you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as\
you passed me. But I wasn\'92t quite sure. Didn\'92t you recognize me?\'94\
\
\'93In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can\'92t even recognize Grosvenor\
Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don\'92t feel at\
all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen\
you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?\'94\
\
\'93No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a\
studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture\
I have in my head. However, it wasn\'92t about myself I wanted to talk.\
Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something\
to say to you.\'94\
\
\'93I shall be charmed. But won\'92t you miss your train?\'94 said Dorian Gray\
languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his\
latch-key.\
\
The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his\
watch. \'93I have heaps of time,\'94 he answered. \'93The train doesn\'92t go till\
twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to\
the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan\'92t have any\
delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with\
me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.\'94\
\
Dorian looked at him and smiled. \'93What a way for a fashionable painter\
to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get\
into the house. And mind you don\'92t talk about anything serious. Nothing\
is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.\'94\
\
Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the\
library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.\
The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with\
some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little\
marqueterie table.\
\
\'93You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me\
everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is\
a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman\
you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?\'94\
\
Dorian shrugged his shoulders. \'93I believe he married Lady Radley\'92s\
maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.\
_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly\
of the French, doesn\'92t it? But\'97do you know?\'97he was not at all a bad\
servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One\
often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted\
to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another\
brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take\
hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.\'94\
\
\'93Thanks, I won\'92t have anything more,\'94 said the painter, taking his cap\
and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the\
corner. \'93And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.\
Don\'92t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.\'94\
\
\'93What is it all about?\'94 cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging\
himself down on the sofa. \'93I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of\
myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.\'94\
\
\'93It is about yourself,\'94 answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, \'93and\
I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.\'94\
\
Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. \'93Half an hour!\'94 he murmured.\
\
\'93It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own\
sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the\
most dreadful things are being said against you in London.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other\
people, but scandals about myself don\'92t interest me. They have not got\
the charm of novelty.\'94\
\
\'93They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his\
good name. You don\'92t want people to talk of you as something vile and\
degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all\
that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind\
you, I don\'92t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can\'92t believe\
them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man\'92s\
face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.\
There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself\
in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of\
his hands even. Somebody\'97I won\'92t mention his name, but you know\
him\'97came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen\
him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though\
I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I\
refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I\
hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.\
His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent\
face, and your marvellous untroubled youth\'97I can\'92t believe anything\
against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to\
the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these\
hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don\'92t know what\
to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves\
the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen\
in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You\
used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.\
Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the\
miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley\
curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,\
but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to\
know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I\
reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.\
He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why\
is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy\
in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There\
was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.\
You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his\
dreadful end? What about Lord Kent\'92s only son and his career? I met his\
father yesterday in St. James\'92s Street. He seemed broken with shame and\
sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he\
got now? What gentleman would associate with him?\'94\
\
\'93Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,\'94\
said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt\
in his voice. \'93You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It\
is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows\
anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could\
his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did\
I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent\'92s\
silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If\
Adrian Singleton writes his friend\'92s name across a bill, am I his\
keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air\
their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper\
about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try\
and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with\
the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to\
have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.\
And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead\
themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land\
of the hypocrite.\'94\
\
\'93Dorian,\'94 cried Hallward, \'93that is not the question. England is bad\
enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why\
I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge\
of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all\
sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a\
madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them\
there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are\
smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are\
inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not\
have made his sister\'92s name a by-word.\'94\
\
\'93Take care, Basil. You go too far.\'94\
\
\'93I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady\
Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a\
single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?\
Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are\
other stories\'97stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of\
dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in\
London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I\
laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your\
country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don\'92t know\
what is said about you. I won\'92t tell you that I don\'92t want to preach to\
you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself\
into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and\
then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want\
you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you\
to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the\
dreadful people you associate with. Don\'92t shrug your shoulders like\
that. Don\'92t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it\
be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with\
whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to\
enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don\'92t know\
whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am\
told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one\
of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife\
had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.\
Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I\
told him that it was absurd\'97that I knew you thoroughly and that you\
were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know\
you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.\'94\
\
\'93To see my soul!\'94 muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and\
turning almost white from fear.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his\
voice, \'93to see your soul. But only God can do that.\'94\
\
A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. \'93You\
shall see it yourself, to-night!\'94 he cried, seizing a lamp from the\
table. \'93Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn\'92t you look at it?\
You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody\
would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the\
better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate\
about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough\
about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.\'94\
\
There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his\
foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible\
joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that\
the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his\
shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous\
memory of what he had done.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into\
his stern eyes, \'93I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that\
you fancy only God can see.\'94\
\
Hallward started back. \'93This is blasphemy, Dorian!\'94 he cried. \'93You must\
not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don\'92t mean\
anything.\'94\
\
\'93You think so?\'94 He laughed again.\
\
\'93I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your\
good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t touch me. Finish what you have to say.\'94\
\
A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter\'92s face. He paused for a\
moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right\
had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of\
what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he\
straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood\
there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their\
throbbing cores of flame.\
\
\'93I am waiting, Basil,\'94 said the young man in a hard clear voice.\
\
He turned round. \'93What I have to say is this,\'94 he cried. \'93You must give\
me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If\
you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I\
shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can\'92t you see what I\
am going through? My God! don\'92t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,\
and shameful.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. \'93Come\
upstairs, Basil,\'94 he said quietly. \'93I keep a diary of my life from day\
to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall\
show it to you if you come with me.\'94\
\
\'93I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my\
train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don\'92t ask me to\
read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.\'94\
\
\'93That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You\
will not have to read long.\'94\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII.\
\
\
He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward\
following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at\
night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A\
rising wind made some of the windows rattle.\
\
When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the\
floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. \'93You insist on\
knowing, Basil?\'94 he asked in a low voice.\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I am delighted,\'94 he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat\
harshly, \'93You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\
everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you\
think\'94; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold\
current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a\
flame of murky orange. He shuddered. \'93Shut the door behind you,\'94 he\
whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.\
\
Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked\
as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a\
curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty\
book-case\'97that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a\
table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was\
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered\
with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling\
behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.\
\
\'93So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that\
curtain back, and you will see mine.\'94\
\
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. \'93You are mad, Dorian, or\
playing a part,\'94 muttered Hallward, frowning.\
\
\'93You won\'92t? Then I must do it myself,\'94 said the young man, and he tore\
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.\
\
An exclamation of horror broke from the painter\'92s lips as he saw in the\
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was\
something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.\
Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray\'92s own face that he was looking at! The\
horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous\
beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet\
on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the\
loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely\
passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it\
was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own\
brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,\
yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the\
picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long\
letters of bright vermilion.\
\
It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never\
done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if\
his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own\
picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at\
Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his\
parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across\
his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.\
\
The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with\
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are\
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither\
real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the\
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken\
the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do\
so.\
\
\'93What does this mean?\'94 cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded\
shrill and curious in his ears.\
\
\'93Years ago, when I was a boy,\'94 said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in\
his hand, \'93you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my\
good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who\
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me\
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even\
now, I don\'92t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you\
would call it a prayer....\'94\
\
\'93I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is\
impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The\
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the\
thing is impossible.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, what is impossible?\'94 murmured the young man, going over to the\
window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.\
\
\'93You told me you had destroyed it.\'94\
\
\'93I was wrong. It has destroyed me.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t believe it is my picture.\'94\
\
\'93Can\'92t you see your ideal in it?\'94 said Dorian bitterly.\
\
\'93My ideal, as you call it...\'94\
\
\'93As you called it.\'94\
\
\'93There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an\
ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.\'94\
\
\'93It is the face of my soul.\'94\
\
\'93Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a\
devil.\'94\
\
\'93Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,\'94 cried Dorian with a\
wild gesture of despair.\
\
Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. \'93My God! If it\
is true,\'94 he exclaimed, \'93and this is what you have done with your life,\
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you\
to be!\'94 He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The\
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was\
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through\
some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly\
eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was\
not so fearful.\
\
His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and\
lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he\
flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and\
buried his face in his hands.\
\
\'93Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!\'94 There was no\
answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. \'93Pray,\
Dorian, pray,\'94 he murmured. \'93What is it that one was taught to say in\
one\'92s boyhood? \'91Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash\
away our iniquities.\'92 Let us say that together. The prayer of your\
pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered\
also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped\
yourself too much. We are both punished.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed\
eyes. \'93It is too late, Basil,\'94 he faltered.\
\
\'93It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot\
remember a prayer. Isn\'92t there a verse somewhere, \'91Though your sins be\
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow\'92?\'94\
\
\'93Those words mean nothing to me now.\'94\
\
\'93Hush! Don\'92t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!\
Don\'92t you see that accursed thing leering at us?\'94\
\
Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable\
feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had\
been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his\
ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred\
within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more\
than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly\
around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced\
him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he\
had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had\
forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing\
Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and\
turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.\
He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind\
the ear, crushing the man\'92s head down on the table and stabbing again\
and again.\
\
There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking\
with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,\
waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice\
more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the\
floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he\
threw the knife on the table, and listened.\
\
He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He\
opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely\
quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the\
balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.\
Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in\
as he did so.\
\
The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with\
bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been\
for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was\
slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was\
simply asleep.\
\
How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking\
over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind\
had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock\'92s\
tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the\
policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on\
the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom\
gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl\
was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and\
then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse\
voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She\
stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The\
gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their\
black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the\
window behind him.\
\
Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not\
even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole\
thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the\
fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his\
life. That was enough.\
\
Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish\
workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\
steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed\
by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a\
moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not\
help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the\
long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.\
\
Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The\
woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped\
several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the\
sound of his own footsteps.\
\
When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\
They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was\
in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,\
and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he\
pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.\
\
He sat down and began to think. Every year\'97every month, almost\'97men were\
strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of\
murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....\
And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left\
the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the\
servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.\
It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he\
had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months\
before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be\
destroyed long before then.\
\
A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went\
out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the\
policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the\
bull\'92s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.\
\
After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting\
the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In\
about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very\
drowsy.\
\
\'93I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,\'94 he said, stepping in;\
\'93but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?\'94\
\
\'93Ten minutes past two, sir,\'94 answered the man, looking at the clock and\
blinking.\
\
\'93Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine\
to-morrow. I have some work to do.\'94\
\
\'93All right, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Did any one call this evening?\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away\
to catch his train.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! I am sorry I didn\'92t see him. Did he leave any message?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not\
find you at the club.\'94\
\
\'93That will do, Francis. Don\'92t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.\'94\
\
\'93No, sir.\'94\
\
The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.\
\
Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the\
library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,\
biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one\
of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. \'93Alan Campbell, 152,\
Hertford Street, Mayfair.\'94 Yes; that was the man he wanted.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIV.\
\
\
At nine o\'92clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of\
chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite\
peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his\
cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.\
\
The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as\
he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he\
had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.\
His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But\
youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.\
\
He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his\
chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The\
sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost\
like a morning in May.\
\
Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,\
blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there\
with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had\
suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for\
Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came\
back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still\
sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!\
Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.\
\
He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken\
or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory\
than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride\
more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of\
joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the\
senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out\
of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might\
strangle one itself.\
\
When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and\
then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual\
care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and\
scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time\
also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet\
about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the\
servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the\
letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times\
over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.\
\'93That awful thing, a woman\'92s memory!\'94 as Lord Henry had once said.\
\
After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly\
with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the\
table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the\
other he handed to the valet.\
\
\'93Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell\
is out of town, get his address.\'94\
\
As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a\
piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and\
then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew\
seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and\
getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.\
He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until\
it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.\
\
When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page\
of the book. It was Gautier\'92s \'93\'c9maux et Cam\'e9es\'94, Charpentier\'92s\
Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of\
citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\
pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he\
turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of\
Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand \'93_du supplice encore mal lav\'e9e_,\'94 with\
its downy red hairs and its \'93_doigts de faune_.\'94 He glanced at his own\
white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and\
passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:\
\
Sur une gamme chromatique,\
    Le sein de perles ruisselant,\
La V\'e9nus de l\'92Adriatique\
    Sort de l\'92eau son corps rose et blanc.\
\
Les d\'f4mes, sur l\'92azur des ondes\
    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,\
S\'92enflent comme des gorges rondes\
    Que soul\'e8ve un soupir d\'92amour.\
\
L\'92esquif aborde et me d\'e9pose,\
    Jetant son amarre au pilier,\
Devant une fa\'e7ade rose,\
    Sur le marbre d\'92un escalier.\
\
\
How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating\
down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black\
gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked\
to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as\
one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him\
of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the\
tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through\
the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he\
kept saying over and over to himself:\
\
\'93Devant une fa\'e7ade rose,\
Sur le marbre d\'92un escalier.\'94\
\
\
The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn\
that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to\
mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,\
like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true\
romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had\
been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor\
Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!\
\
He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read\
of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _caf\'e9_ at Smyrna\
where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned\
merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each\
other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps\
tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by\
the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red\
ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small\
beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood\
over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell\
of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\
\'93_monstre charmant_\'94 that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.\
But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a\
horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be\
out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he\
might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital\
importance.\
\
They had been great friends once, five years before\'97almost inseparable,\
indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in\
society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never\
did.\
\
He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real\
appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the\
beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His\
dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had\
spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken\
a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was\
still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his\
own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the\
annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for\
Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up\
prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and\
played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In\
fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray\
together\'97music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be\
able to exercise whenever he wished\'97and, indeed, exercised often\
without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire\'92s the\
night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always\
seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For\
eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at\
Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian\
Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in\
life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever\
knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they\
met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at\
which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too\'97was strangely\
melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and\
would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called\
upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in\
which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to\
become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice\
in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious\
experiments.\
\
This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept\
glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly\
agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,\
looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.\
His hands were curiously cold.\
\
The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with\
feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the\
jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting\
for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands\
his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight\
and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain\
had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made\
grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,\
danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving\
masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,\
slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being\
dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its\
grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him\
stone.\
\
At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes\
upon him.\
\
\'93Mr. Campbell, sir,\'94 said the man.\
\
A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back\
to his cheeks.\
\
\'93Ask him to come in at once, Francis.\'94 He felt that he was himself\
again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.\
\
The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,\
looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his\
coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.\
\
\'93Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.\'94\
\
\'93I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it\
was a matter of life and death.\'94 His voice was hard and cold. He spoke\
with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady\
searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the\
pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the\
gesture with which he had been greeted.\
\
\'93Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one\
person. Sit down.\'94\
\
Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The\
two men\'92s eyes met. In Dorian\'92s there was infinite pity. He knew that\
what he was going to do was dreadful.\
\
After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very\
quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he\
had sent for, \'93Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room\
to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.\
He has been dead ten hours now. Don\'92t stir, and don\'92t look at me like\
that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not\
concern you. What you have to do is this\'97\'94\
\
\'93Stop, Gray. I don\'92t want to know anything further. Whether what you\
have told me is true or not true doesn\'92t concern me. I entirely decline\
to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.\
They don\'92t interest me any more.\'94\
\
\'93Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest\
you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can\'92t help myself. You are\
the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the\
matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about\
chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you\
have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs\'97to destroy it\
so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come\
into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in\
Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must\
be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and\
everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may\
scatter in the air.\'94\
\
\'93You are mad, Dorian.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.\'94\
\
\'93You are mad, I tell you\'97mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to\
help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to\
do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril\
my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil\'92s work you are up\
to?\'94\
\
\'93It was suicide, Alan.\'94\
\
\'93I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.\'94\
\
\'93Do you still refuse to do this for me?\'94\
\
\'93Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I\
don\'92t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be\
sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of\
all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have\
thought you knew more about people\'92s characters. Your friend Lord Henry\
Wotton can\'92t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he\
has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You\
have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don\'92t come to\
me.\'94\
\
\'93Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don\'92t know what he had made me\
suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the\
marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the\
result was the same.\'94\
\
\'93Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not\
inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in\
the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime\
without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.\'94\
\
\'93You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to\
me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain\
scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the\
horrors that you do there don\'92t affect you. If in some hideous\
dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a\
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow\
through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You\
would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing\
anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were\
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the\
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.\
What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.\
Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are\
accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence\
against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be\
discovered unless you help me.\'94\
\
\'93I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent\
to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.\'94\
\
\'93Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you\
came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some\
day. No! don\'92t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the\
scientific point of view. You don\'92t inquire where the dead things on\
which you experiment come from. Don\'92t inquire now. I have told you too\
much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,\
Alan.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t speak about those days, Dorian\'97they are dead.\'94\
\
\'93The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is\
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!\
If you don\'92t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang\
me, Alan! Don\'92t you understand? They will hang me for what I have\
done.\'94\
\
\'93There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do\
anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.\'94\
\
\'93You refuse?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I entreat you, Alan.\'94\
\
\'93It is useless.\'94\
\
The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray\'92s eyes. Then he stretched\
out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read\
it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.\
Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.\
\
Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and\
opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back\
in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if\
his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.\
\
After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and\
came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.\
\
\'93I am so sorry for you, Alan,\'94 he murmured, \'93but you leave me no\
alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the\
address. If you don\'92t help me, I must send it. If you don\'92t help me, I\
will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to\
help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.\
You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,\
offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me\'97no\
living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate\
terms.\'94\
\
Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through\
him.\
\
\'93Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The\
thing is quite simple. Come, don\'92t work yourself into this fever. The\
thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.\'94\
\
A groan broke from Campbell\'92s lips and he shivered all over. The\
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing\
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be\
borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his\
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already\
come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.\
It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.\
\
\'93Come, Alan, you must decide at once.\'94\
\
\'93I cannot do it,\'94 he said, mechanically, as though words could alter\
things.\
\
\'93You must. You have no choice. Don\'92t delay.\'94\
\
He hesitated a moment. \'93Is there a fire in the room upstairs?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.\'94\
\
\'93I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.\'94\
\
\'93No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of\
notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the\
things back to you.\'94\
\
Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope\
to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then\
he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as\
soon as possible and to bring the things with him.\
\
As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up\
from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a\
kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A\
fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was\
like the beat of a hammer.\
\
As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian\
Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in\
the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.\
\'93You are infamous, absolutely infamous!\'94 he muttered.\
\
\'93Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,\'94 said Dorian.\
\
\'93Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from\
corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In\
doing what I am going to do\'97what you force me to do\'97it is not of your\
life that I am thinking.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, Alan,\'94 murmured Dorian with a sigh, \'93I wish you had a thousandth\
part of the pity for me that I have for you.\'94 He turned away as he\
spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.\
\
After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant\
entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil\
of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.\
\
\'93Shall I leave the things here, sir?\'94 he asked Campbell.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Dorian. \'93And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another\
errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies\
Selby with orchids?\'94\
\
\'93Harden, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Yes\'97Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden\
personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,\
and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don\'92t want any\
white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty\
place\'97otherwise I wouldn\'92t bother you about it.\'94\
\
\'93No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?\'94\
\
Dorian looked at Campbell. \'93How long will your experiment take, Alan?\'94\
he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in\
the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.\
\
Campbell frowned and bit his lip. \'93It will take about five hours,\'94 he\
answered.\
\
\'93It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,\
Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have\
the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want\
you.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, sir,\'94 said the man, leaving the room.\
\
\'93Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!\
I\'92ll take it for you. You bring the other things.\'94 He spoke rapidly and\
in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left\
the room together.\
\
When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned\
it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his\
eyes. He shuddered. \'93I don\'92t think I can go in, Alan,\'94 he murmured.\
\
\'93It is nothing to me. I don\'92t require you,\'94 said Campbell coldly.\
\
Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his\
portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn\
curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had\
forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,\
and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.\
\
What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on\
one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible\
it was!\'97more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent\
thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose\
grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had\
not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.\
\
He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with\
half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that\
he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and\
taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the\
picture.\
\
There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed\
themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard\
Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other\
things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder\
if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had\
thought of each other.\
\
\'93Leave me now,\'94 said a stern voice behind him.\
\
He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been\
thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a\
glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key\
being turned in the lock.\
\
It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He\
was pale, but absolutely calm. \'93I have done what you asked me to do,\'94\
he muttered. \'93And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.\'94\
\
\'93You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,\'94 said Dorian\
simply.\
\
As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible\
smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting\
at the table was gone.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XV.\
\
\
That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large\
button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady\
Narborough\'92s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was\
throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his\
manner as he bent over his hostess\'92s hand was as easy and graceful as\
ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one\'92s ease as when one has to\
play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could\
have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any\
tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have\
clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God\
and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his\
demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a\
double life.\
\
It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who\
was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the\
remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife\
to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband\
properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and\
married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted\
herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and\
French _esprit_ when she could get it.\
\
Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that\
she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. \'93I know, my\
dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,\'94 she used to say,\
\'93and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most\
fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our\
bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to\
raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.\
However, that was all Narborough\'92s fault. He was dreadfully\
short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who\
never sees anything.\'94\
\
Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she\
explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married\
daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make\
matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. \'93I think it\
is most unkind of her, my dear,\'94 she whispered. \'93Of course I go and\
stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old\
woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake\
them up. You don\'92t know what an existence they lead down there. It is\
pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have\
so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to\
think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since\
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep\
after dinner. You shan\'92t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me\
and amuse me.\'94\
\
Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:\
it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen\
before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those\
middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,\
but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an\
overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always\
trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to\
her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against\
her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and\
Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess\'92s daughter, a dowdy\
dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once\
seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,\
white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the\
impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of\
ideas.\
\
He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the\
great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the\
mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: \'93How horrid of Henry Wotton to be\
so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised\
faithfully not to disappoint me.\'94\
\
It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door\
opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some\
insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.\
\
But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away\
untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called \'93an\
insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,\'94 and\
now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence\
and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass\
with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.\
\
\'93Dorian,\'94 said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being\
handed round, \'93what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out\
of sorts.\'94\
\
\'93I believe he is in love,\'94 cried Lady Narborough, \'93and that he is\
afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I\
certainly should.\'94\
\
\'93Dear Lady Narborough,\'94 murmured Dorian, smiling, \'93I have not been in\
love for a whole week\'97not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.\'94\
\
\'93How you men can fall in love with that woman!\'94 exclaimed the old lady.\
\'93I really cannot understand it.\'94\
\
\'93It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,\
Lady Narborough,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93She is the one link between us and\
your short frocks.\'94\
\
\'93She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I\
remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _d\'e9collet\'e9e_\
she was then.\'94\
\
\'93She is still _d\'e9collet\'e9e_,\'94 he answered, taking an olive in his long\
fingers; \'93and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an\
_\'e9dition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and\
full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.\
When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\'94\
\
\'93How can you, Harry!\'94 cried Dorian.\
\
\'93It is a most romantic explanation,\'94 laughed the hostess. \'93But her\
third husband, Lord Henry! You don\'92t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, Lady Narborough.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t believe a word of it.\'94\
\
\'93Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.\'94\
\
\'93Is it true, Mr. Gray?\'94\
\
\'93She assures me so, Lady Narborough,\'94 said Dorian. \'93I asked her\
whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and\
hung at her girdle. She told me she didn\'92t, because none of them had\
had any hearts at all.\'94\
\
\'93Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de z\'eale_.\'94\
\
\'93_Trop d\'92audace_, I tell her,\'94 said Dorian.\
\
\'93Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol\
like? I don\'92t know him.\'94\
\
\'93The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,\'94\
said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.\
\
Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. \'93Lord Henry, I am not at all\
surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.\'94\
\
\'93But what world says that?\'94 asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.\
\'93It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent\
terms.\'94\
\
\'93Everybody I know says you are very wicked,\'94 cried the old lady,\
shaking her head.\
\
Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. \'93It is perfectly\
monstrous,\'94 he said, at last, \'93the way people go about nowadays saying\
things against one behind one\'92s back that are absolutely and entirely\
true.\'94\
\
\'93Isn\'92t he incorrigible?\'94 cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.\
\
\'93I hope so,\'94 said his hostess, laughing. \'93But really, if you all\
worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry\
again so as to be in the fashion.\'94\
\
\'93You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,\'94 broke in Lord Henry.\
\'93You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she\
detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he\
adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.\'94\
\
\'93Narborough wasn\'92t perfect,\'94 cried the old lady.\
\
\'93If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,\'94 was the\
rejoinder. \'93Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,\
they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never\
ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,\
but it is quite true.\'94\
\
\'93Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for\
your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be\
married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,\
that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like\
bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.\'94\
\
\'93_Fin de si\'eacle_,\'94 murmured Lord Henry.\
\
\'93_Fin du globe_,\'94 answered his hostess.\
\
\'93I wish it were _fin du globe_,\'94 said Dorian with a sigh. \'93Life is a\
great disappointment.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, my dear,\'94 cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, \'93don\'92t\
tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows\
that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes\
wish that I had been; but you are made to be good\'97you look so good. I\
must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don\'92t you think that Mr. Gray\
should get married?\'94\
\
\'93I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,\'94 said Lord Henry with a\
bow.\
\
\'93Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go\
through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the\
eligible young ladies.\'94\
\
\'93With their ages, Lady Narborough?\'94 asked Dorian.\
\
\'93Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done\
in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable\
alliance, and I want you both to be happy.\'94\
\
\'93What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!\'94 exclaimed Lord\
Henry. \'93A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love\
her.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! what a cynic you are!\'94 cried the old lady, pushing back her chair\
and nodding to Lady Ruxton. \'93You must come and dine with me soon again.\
You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew\
prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,\
though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.\'94\
\
\'93I like men who have a future and women who have a past,\'94 he answered.\
\'93Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?\'94\
\
\'93I fear so,\'94 she said, laughing, as she stood up. \'93A thousand pardons,\
my dear Lady Ruxton,\'94 she added, \'93I didn\'92t see you hadn\'92t finished your\
cigarette.\'94\
\
\'93Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going\
to limit myself, for the future.\'94\
\
\'93Pray don\'92t, Lady Ruxton,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93Moderation is a fatal\
thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a\
feast.\'94\
\
Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. \'93You must come and explain that\
to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,\'94 she\
murmured, as she swept out of the room.\
\
\'93Now, mind you don\'92t stay too long over your politics and scandal,\'94\
cried Lady Narborough from the door. \'93If you do, we are sure to\
squabble upstairs.\'94\
\
The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the\
table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and\
sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the\
situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The\
word _doctrinaire_\'97word full of terror to the British mind\'97reappeared\
from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served\
as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles\
of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race\'97sound English common\
sense he jovially termed it\'97was shown to be the proper bulwark for\
society.\
\
A smile curved Lord Henry\'92s lips, and he turned round and looked at\
Dorian.\
\
\'93Are you better, my dear fellow?\'94 he asked. \'93You seemed rather out of\
sorts at dinner.\'94\
\
\'93I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.\'94\
\
\'93You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to\
you. She tells me she is going down to Selby.\'94\
\
\'93She has promised to come on the twentieth.\'94\
\
\'93Is Monmouth to be there, too?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very\
clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of\
weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image\
precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.\
White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and\
what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.\'94\
\
\'93How long has she been married?\'94 asked Dorian.\
\
\'93An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is\
ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,\
with time thrown in. Who else is coming?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey\
Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.\'94\
\
\'93I like him,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93A great many people don\'92t, but I find\
him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by\
being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to\
Monte Carlo with his father.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! what a nuisance people\'92s people are! Try and make him come. By the\
way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.\
What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?\'94\
\
Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.\
\
\'93No, Harry,\'94 he said at last, \'93I did not get home till nearly three.\'94\
\
\'93Did you go to the club?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he answered. Then he bit his lip. \'93No, I don\'92t mean that. I\
didn\'92t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How\
inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been\
doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at\
half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my\
latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any\
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.\'94\
\
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. \'93My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let\
us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.\
Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not\
yourself to-night.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come\
round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady\
Narborough. I shan\'92t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.\'94\
\
\'93All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.\
The duchess is coming.\'94\
\
\'93I will try to be there, Harry,\'94 he said, leaving the room. As he drove\
back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he\
thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry\'92s casual\
questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted\
his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He\
winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.\
\
Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the\
door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had\
thrust Basil Hallward\'92s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled\
another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning\
leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume\
everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some\
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and\
forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\
\
Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed\
nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large\
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue\
lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and\
make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet\
almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He\
lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the\
long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the\
cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,\
went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A\
triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively\
towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese\
box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides\
patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round\
crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside\
was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and\
persistent.\
\
He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his\
face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly\
hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes\
to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did\
so, and went into his bedroom.\
\
As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,\
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept\
quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good\
horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.\
\
The man shook his head. \'93It is too far for me,\'94 he muttered.\
\
\'93Here is a sovereign for you,\'94 said Dorian. \'93You shall have another if\
you drive fast.\'94\
\
\'93All right, sir,\'94 answered the man, \'93you will be there in an hour,\'94 and\
after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly\
towards the river.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVI.\
\
\
A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly\
in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men\
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some\
of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards\
brawled and screamed.\
\
Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian\
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and\
now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said\
to him on the first day they had met, \'93To cure the soul by means of the\
senses, and the senses by means of the soul.\'94 Yes, that was the secret.\
He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium\
dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of\
old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.\
\
The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a\
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The\
gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the\
man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from\
the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom\
were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.\
\
\'93To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of\
the soul!\'94 How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was\
sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent\
blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there\
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness\
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing\
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.\
Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who\
had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were\
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.\
\
On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each\
step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The\
hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and\
his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse\
madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in\
answer, and the man was silent.\
\
The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some\
sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist\
thickened, he felt afraid.\
\
Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and\
he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,\
fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in\
the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a\
rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.\
\
After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over\
rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then\
fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He\
watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made\
gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.\
As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open\
door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The\
driver beat at them with his whip.\
\
It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with\
hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped\
those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in\
them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by\
intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would\
still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept\
the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all\
man\'92s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.\
Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,\
became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one\
reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of\
disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more\
vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious\
shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for\
forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.\
\
Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over\
the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black\
masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the\
yards.\
\
\'93Somewhere about here, sir, ain\'92t it?\'94 he asked huskily through the\
trap.\
\
Dorian started and peered round. \'93This will do,\'94 he answered, and\
having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had\
promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and\
there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The\
light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an\
outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like\
a wet mackintosh.\
\
He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he\
was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small\
shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of\
the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.\
\
After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being\
unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word\
to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as\
he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that\
swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the\
street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as\
if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring\
gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced\
them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin\
backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered\
with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and\
stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching\
by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing\
their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head\
buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily\
painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,\
mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an\
expression of disgust. \'93He thinks he\'92s got red ants on him,\'94 laughed\
one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and\
began to whimper.\
\
At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a\
darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the\
heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils\
quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow\
hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up\
at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.\
\
\'93You here, Adrian?\'94 muttered Dorian.\
\
\'93Where else should I be?\'94 he answered, listlessly. \'93None of the chaps\
will speak to me now.\'94\
\
\'93I thought you had left England.\'94\
\
\'93Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at\
last. George doesn\'92t speak to me either.... I don\'92t care,\'94 he added\
with a sigh. \'93As long as one has this stuff, one doesn\'92t want friends.\
I think I have had too many friends.\'94\
\
Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such\
fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the\
gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in\
what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were\
teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he\
was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was\
eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of\
Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The\
presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one\
would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.\
\
\'93I am going on to the other place,\'94 he said after a pause.\
\
\'93On the wharf?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won\'92t have her in this place\
now.\'94\
\
Dorian shrugged his shoulders. \'93I am sick of women who love one. Women\
who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.\'94\
\
\'93Much the same.\'94\
\
\'93I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have\
something.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t want anything,\'94 murmured the young man.\
\
\'93Never mind.\'94\
\
Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A\
half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous\
greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of\
them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back\
on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.\
\
A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of\
the women. \'93We are very proud to-night,\'94 she sneered.\
\
\'93For God\'92s sake don\'92t talk to me,\'94 cried Dorian, stamping his foot on\
the ground. \'93What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don\'92t ever talk to me\
again.\'94\
\
Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman\'92s sodden eyes, then\
flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and\
raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion\
watched her enviously.\
\
\'93It\'92s no use,\'94 sighed Adrian Singleton. \'93I don\'92t care to go back. What\
does it matter? I am quite happy here.\'94\
\
\'93You will write to me if you want anything, won\'92t you?\'94 said Dorian,\
after a pause.\
\
\'93Perhaps.\'94\
\
\'93Good night, then.\'94\
\
\'93Good night,\'94 answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping\
his parched mouth with a handkerchief.\
\
Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew\
the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the\
woman who had taken his money. \'93There goes the devil\'92s bargain!\'94 she\
hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.\
\
\'93Curse you!\'94 he answered, \'93don\'92t call me that.\'94\
\
She snapped her fingers. \'93Prince Charming is what you like to be\
called, ain\'92t it?\'94 she yelled after him.\
\
The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly\
round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He\
rushed out as if in pursuit.\
\
Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His\
meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered\
if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as\
Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his\
lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did\
it matter to him? One\'92s days were too brief to take the burden of\
another\'92s errors on one\'92s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and\
paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so\
often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.\
In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.\
\
There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or\
for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of\
the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful\
impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.\
They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken\
from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,\
lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.\
For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of\
disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell\
from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.\
\
Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for\
rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but\
as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a\
short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself\
suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,\
he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his\
throat.\
\
He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the\
tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,\
and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,\
and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.\
\
\'93What do you want?\'94 he gasped.\
\
\'93Keep quiet,\'94 said the man. \'93If you stir, I shoot you.\'94\
\
\'93You are mad. What have I done to you?\'94\
\
\'93You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,\'94 was the answer, \'93and Sibyl Vane\
was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your\
door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.\
I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you\
were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.\
I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night\
you are going to die.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. \'93I never knew her,\'94 he stammered. \'93I\
never heard of her. You are mad.\'94\
\
\'93You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you\
are going to die.\'94 There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know\
what to say or do. \'93Down on your knees!\'94 growled the man. \'93I give you\
one minute to make your peace\'97no more. I go on board to-night for\
India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That\'92s all.\'94\
\
Dorian\'92s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know\
what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. \'93Stop,\'94 he\
cried. \'93How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!\'94\
\
\'93Eighteen years,\'94 said the man. \'93Why do you ask me? What do years\
matter?\'94\
\
\'93Eighteen years,\'94 laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his\
voice. \'93Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!\'94\
\
James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.\
Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.\
\
Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him\
the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face\
of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the\
unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty\
summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been\
when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was\
not the man who had destroyed her life.\
\
He loosened his hold and reeled back. \'93My God! my God!\'94 he cried, \'93and\
I would have murdered you!\'94\
\
Dorian Gray drew a long breath. \'93You have been on the brink of\
committing a terrible crime, my man,\'94 he said, looking at him sternly.\
\'93Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own\
hands.\'94\
\
\'93Forgive me, sir,\'94 muttered James Vane. \'93I was deceived. A chance word\
I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.\'94\
\
\'93You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into\
trouble,\'94 said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the\
street.\
\
James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head\
to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping\
along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him\
with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked\
round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at\
the bar.\
\
\'93Why didn\'92t you kill him?\'94 she hissed out, putting haggard face quite\
close to his. \'93I knew you were following him when you rushed out from\
Daly\'92s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and\
he\'92s as bad as bad.\'94\
\
\'93He is not the man I am looking for,\'94 he answered, \'93and I want no man\'92s\
money. I want a man\'92s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly\
forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not\
got his blood upon my hands.\'94\
\
The woman gave a bitter laugh. \'93Little more than a boy!\'94 she sneered.\
\'93Why, man, it\'92s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me\
what I am.\'94\
\
\'93You lie!\'94 cried James Vane.\
\
She raised her hand up to heaven. \'93Before God I am telling the truth,\'94\
she cried.\
\
\'93Before God?\'94\
\
\'93Strike me dumb if it ain\'92t so. He is the worst one that comes here.\
They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It\'92s nigh\
on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn\'92t changed much since then. I\
have, though,\'94 she added, with a sickly leer.\
\
\'93You swear this?\'94\
\
\'93I swear it,\'94 came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. \'93But don\'92t give\
me away to him,\'94 she whined; \'93I am afraid of him. Let me have some\
money for my night\'92s lodging.\'94\
\
He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,\
but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had\
vanished also.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVII.\
\
\
A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby\
Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,\
a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,\
and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the\
table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at\
which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily\
among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that\
Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped\
wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady\
Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke\'92s description of the last\
Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men\
in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.\
The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more\
expected to arrive on the next day.\
\
\'93What are you two talking about?\'94 said Lord Henry, strolling over to\
the table and putting his cup down. \'93I hope Dorian has told you about\
my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.\'94\
\
\'93But I don\'92t want to be rechristened, Harry,\'94 rejoined the duchess,\
looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. \'93I am quite satisfied with\
my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are\
both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an\
orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as\
effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one\
of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen\
of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad\
truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.\
Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is\
with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The\
man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It\
is the only thing he is fit for.\'94\
\
\'93Then what should we call you, Harry?\'94 she asked.\
\
\'93His name is Prince Paradox,\'94 said Dorian.\
\
\'93I recognize him in a flash,\'94 exclaimed the duchess.\
\
\'93I won\'92t hear of it,\'94 laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. \'93From a\
label there is no escape! I refuse the title.\'94\
\
\'93Royalties may not abdicate,\'94 fell as a warning from pretty lips.\
\
\'93You wish me to defend my throne, then?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I give the truths of to-morrow.\'94\
\
\'93I prefer the mistakes of to-day,\'94 she answered.\
\
\'93You disarm me, Gladys,\'94 he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.\
\
\'93Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.\'94\
\
\'93I never tilt against beauty,\'94 he said, with a wave of his hand.\
\
\'93That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.\'94\
\
\'93How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be\
beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready\
than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.\'94\
\
\'93Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?\'94 cried the duchess.\
\'93What becomes of your simile about the orchid?\'94\
\
\'93Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good\
Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly\
virtues have made our England what she is.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t like your country, then?\'94 she asked.\
\
\'93I live in it.\'94\
\
\'93That you may censure it the better.\'94\
\
\'93Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?\'94 he inquired.\
\
\'93What do they say of us?\'94\
\
\'93That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.\'94\
\
\'93Is that yours, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93I give it to you.\'94\
\
\'93I could not use it. It is too true.\'94\
\
\'93You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.\'94\
\
\'93They are practical.\'94\
\
\'93They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,\
they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.\'94\
\
\'93Still, we have done great things.\'94\
\
\'93Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.\'94\
\
\'93We have carried their burden.\'94\
\
\'93Only as far as the Stock Exchange.\'94\
\
She shook her head. \'93I believe in the race,\'94 she cried.\
\
\'93It represents the survival of the pushing.\'94\
\
\'93It has development.\'94\
\
\'93Decay fascinates me more.\'94\
\
\'93What of art?\'94 she asked.\
\
\'93It is a malady.\'94\
\
\'93Love?\'94\
\
\'93An illusion.\'94\
\
\'93Religion?\'94\
\
\'93The fashionable substitute for belief.\'94\
\
\'93You are a sceptic.\'94\
\
\'93Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.\'94\
\
\'93What are you?\'94\
\
\'93To define is to limit.\'94\
\
\'93Give me a clue.\'94\
\
\'93Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.\'94\
\
\'93You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.\'94\
\
\'93Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince\
Charming.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! don\'92t remind me of that,\'94 cried Dorian Gray.\
\
\'93Our host is rather horrid this evening,\'94 answered the duchess,\
colouring. \'93I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely\
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern\
butterfly.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I hope he won\'92t stick pins into you, Duchess,\'94 laughed Dorian.\
\
\'93Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.\'94\
\
\'93And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?\'94\
\
\'93For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I\
come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by\
half-past eight.\'94\
\
\'93How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.\'94\
\
\'93I daren\'92t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the\
one I wore at Lady Hilstone\'92s garden-party? You don\'92t, but it is nice\
of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All\
good hats are made out of nothing.\'94\
\
\'93Like all good reputations, Gladys,\'94 interrupted Lord Henry. \'93Every\
effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be\
a mediocrity.\'94\
\
\'93Not with women,\'94 said the duchess, shaking her head; \'93and women rule\
the world. I assure you we can\'92t bear mediocrities. We women, as some\
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if\
you ever love at all.\'94\
\
\'93It seems to me that we never do anything else,\'94 murmured Dorian.\
\
\'93Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,\'94 answered the duchess with\
mock sadness.\
\
\'93My dear Gladys!\'94 cried Lord Henry. \'93How can you say that? Romance\
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.\
Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.\
Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely\
intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,\
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as\
possible.\'94\
\
\'93Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?\'94 asked the duchess after\
a pause.\
\
\'93Especially when one has been wounded by it,\'94 answered Lord Henry.\
\
The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression\
in her eyes. \'93What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?\'94 she inquired.\
\
Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.\
\'93I always agree with Harry, Duchess.\'94\
\
\'93Even when he is wrong?\'94\
\
\'93Harry is never wrong, Duchess.\'94\
\
\'93And does his philosophy make you happy?\'94\
\
\'93I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have\
searched for pleasure.\'94\
\
\'93And found it, Mr. Gray?\'94\
\
\'93Often. Too often.\'94\
\
The duchess sighed. \'93I am searching for peace,\'94 she said, \'93and if I\
don\'92t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.\'94\
\
\'93Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,\'94 cried Dorian, starting to his\
feet and walking down the conservatory.\
\
\'93You are flirting disgracefully with him,\'94 said Lord Henry to his\
cousin. \'93You had better take care. He is very fascinating.\'94\
\
\'93If he were not, there would be no battle.\'94\
\
\'93Greek meets Greek, then?\'94\
\
\'93I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.\'94\
\
\'93They were defeated.\'94\
\
\'93There are worse things than capture,\'94 she answered.\
\
\'93You gallop with a loose rein.\'94\
\
\'93Pace gives life,\'94 was the _riposte_.\
\
\'93I shall write it in my diary to-night.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93That a burnt child loves the fire.\'94\
\
\'93I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.\'94\
\
\'93You use them for everything, except flight.\'94\
\
\'93Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.\'94\
\
\'93You have a rival.\'94\
\
\'93Who?\'94\
\
He laughed. \'93Lady Narborough,\'94 he whispered. \'93She perfectly adores\
him.\'94\
\
\'93You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us\
who are romanticists.\'94\
\
\'93Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.\'94\
\
\'93Men have educated us.\'94\
\
\'93But not explained you.\'94\
\
\'93Describe us as a sex,\'94 was her challenge.\
\
\'93Sphinxes without secrets.\'94\
\
She looked at him, smiling. \'93How long Mr. Gray is!\'94 she said. \'93Let us\
go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.\'94\
\
\'93That would be a premature surrender.\'94\
\
\'93Romantic art begins with its climax.\'94\
\
\'93I must keep an opportunity for retreat.\'94\
\
\'93In the Parthian manner?\'94\
\
\'93They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.\'94\
\
\'93Women are not always allowed a choice,\'94 he answered, but hardly had he\
finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came\
a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody\
started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in\
his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian\
Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.\
\
He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of\
the sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with\
a dazed expression.\
\
\'93What has happened?\'94 he asked. \'93Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?\'94\
He began to tremble.\
\
\'93My dear Dorian,\'94 answered Lord Henry, \'93you merely fainted. That was\
all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to\
dinner. I will take your place.\'94\
\
\'93No, I will come down,\'94 he said, struggling to his feet. \'93I would\
rather come down. I must not be alone.\'94\
\
He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of\
gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of\
terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the\
window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the\
face of James Vane watching him.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVIII.\
\
\
The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the\
time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet\
indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,\
tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but\
tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against\
the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild\
regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor\'92s face\
peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to\
lay its hand upon his heart.\
\
But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of\
the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual\
life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the\
imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of\
sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen\
brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor\
the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon\
the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round\
the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had\
any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have\
reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane\'92s brother had\
not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in\
some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did\
not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had\
saved him.\
\
And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think\
that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them\
visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would\
his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from\
silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear\
as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!\
As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and\
the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a\
wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere\
memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back\
to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and\
swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in\
at six o\'92clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.\
\
It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was\
something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that\
seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it\
was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused\
the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish\
that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle\
and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions\
must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves\
die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows\
that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had\
convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken\
imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity\
and not a little of contempt.\
\
After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden\
and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp\
frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue\
metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.\
\
At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey\
Clouston, the duchess\'92s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of\
his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the\
mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken\
and rough undergrowth.\
\
\'93Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the\
open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new\
ground.\'94\
\
Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and\
red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters\
ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that\
followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful\
freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high\
indifference of joy.\
\
Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front\
of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it\
forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir\
Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the\
animal\'92s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he\
cried out at once, \'93Don\'92t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.\'94\
\
\'93What nonsense, Dorian!\'94 laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded\
into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a\
hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is\
worse.\
\
\'93Good heavens! I have hit a beater!\'94 exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. \'93What an\
ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!\'94 he\
called out at the top of his voice. \'93A man is hurt.\'94\
\
The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.\
\
\'93Where, sir? Where is he?\'94 he shouted. At the same time, the firing\
ceased along the line.\
\
\'93Here,\'94 answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.\
\'93Why on earth don\'92t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the\
day.\'94\
\
Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the\
lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging\
a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It\
seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir\
Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of\
the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with\
faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of\
voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the\
boughs overhead.\
\
After a few moments\'97that were to him, in his perturbed state, like\
endless hours of pain\'97he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started\
and looked round.\
\
\'93Dorian,\'94 said Lord Henry, \'93I had better tell them that the shooting is\
stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.\'94\
\
\'93I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,\'94 he answered bitterly. \'93The\
whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?\'94\
\
He could not finish the sentence.\
\
\'93I am afraid so,\'94 rejoined Lord Henry. \'93He got the whole charge of shot\
in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go\
home.\'94\
\
They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly\
fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and\
said, with a heavy sigh, \'93It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.\'94\
\
\'93What is?\'94 asked Lord Henry. \'93Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear\
fellow, it can\'92t be helped. It was the man\'92s own fault. Why did he get\
in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather\
awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It\
makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he\
shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.\'94\
\
Dorian shook his head. \'93It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something\
horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,\'94 he\
added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.\
\
The elder man laughed. \'93The only horrible thing in the world is\
_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.\
But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep\
chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the\
subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an\
omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel\
for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have\
everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would\
not be delighted to change places with you.\'94\
\
\'93There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don\'92t\
laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who\
has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is\
the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to\
wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don\'92t you see a man\
moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?\'94\
\
Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand\
was pointing. \'93Yes,\'94 he said, smiling, \'93I see the gardener waiting for\
you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the\
table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must\
come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.\'94\
\
Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The\
man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating\
manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. \'93Her\
Grace told me to wait for an answer,\'94 he murmured.\
\
Dorian put the letter into his pocket. \'93Tell her Grace that I am coming\
in,\'94 he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the\
direction of the house.\
\
\'93How fond women are of doing dangerous things!\'94 laughed Lord Henry. \'93It\
is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt\
with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.\'94\
\
\'93How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present\
instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I\
don\'92t love her.\'94\
\
\'93And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you\
are excellently matched.\'94\
\
\'93You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for\
scandal.\'94\
\
\'93The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,\'94 said Lord Henry,\
lighting a cigarette.\
\
\'93You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.\'94\
\
\'93The world goes to the altar of its own accord,\'94 was the answer.\
\
\'93I wish I could love,\'94 cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in\
his voice. \'93But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the\
desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has\
become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was\
silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to\
Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.\'94\
\
\'93Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what\
it is? You know I would help you.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t tell you, Harry,\'94 he answered sadly. \'93And I dare say it is\
only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a\
horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.\'94\
\
\'93What nonsense!\'94\
\
\'93I hope it is, but I can\'92t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,\
looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,\
Duchess.\'94\
\
\'93I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,\'94 she answered. \'93Poor Geoffrey is\
terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.\
How curious!\'94\
\
\'93Yes, it was very curious. I don\'92t know what made me say it. Some whim,\
I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am\
sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.\'94\
\
\'93It is an annoying subject,\'94 broke in Lord Henry. \'93It has no\
psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on\
purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one\
who had committed a real murder.\'94\
\
\'93How horrid of you, Harry!\'94 cried the duchess. \'93Isn\'92t it, Mr. Gray?\
Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.\'94\
\
Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. \'93It is nothing,\
Duchess,\'94 he murmured; \'93my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is\
all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn\'92t hear what\
Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think\
I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won\'92t you?\'94\
\
They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the\
conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,\
Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.\
\'93Are you very much in love with him?\'94 he asked.\
\
She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. \'93I\
wish I knew,\'94 she said at last.\
\
He shook his head. \'93Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty\
that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.\'94\
\
\'93One may lose one\'92s way.\'94\
\
\'93All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.\'94\
\
\'93What is that?\'94\
\
\'93Disillusion.\'94\
\
\'93It was my _d\'e9but_ in life,\'94 she sighed.\
\
\'93It came to you crowned.\'94\
\
\'93I am tired of strawberry leaves.\'94\
\
\'93They become you.\'94\
\
\'93Only in public.\'94\
\
\'93You would miss them,\'94 said Lord Henry.\
\
\'93I will not part with a petal.\'94\
\
\'93Monmouth has ears.\'94\
\
\'93Old age is dull of hearing.\'94\
\
\'93Has he never been jealous?\'94\
\
\'93I wish he had been.\'94\
\
He glanced about as if in search of something. \'93What are you looking\
for?\'94 she inquired.\
\
\'93The button from your foil,\'94 he answered. \'93You have dropped it.\'94\
\
She laughed. \'93I have still the mask.\'94\
\
\'93It makes your eyes lovelier,\'94 was his reply.\
\
She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet\
fruit.\
\
Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror\
in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too\
hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky\
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to\
pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord\
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.\
\
At five o\'92clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to\
pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham\
at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another\
night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in\
the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.\
\
Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to\
town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in\
his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to\
the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see\
him. He frowned and bit his lip. \'93Send him in,\'94 he muttered, after some\
moments\'92 hesitation.\
\
As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a\
drawer and spread it out before him.\
\
\'93I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this\
morning, Thornton?\'94 he said, taking up a pen.\
\
\'93Yes, sir,\'94 answered the gamekeeper.\
\
\'93Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?\'94\
asked Dorian, looking bored. \'93If so, I should not like them to be left\
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.\'94\
\
\'93We don\'92t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of\
coming to you about.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t know who he is?\'94 said Dorian, listlessly. \'93What do you mean?\
Wasn\'92t he one of your men?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.\'94\
\
The pen dropped from Dorian Gray\'92s hand, and he felt as if his heart\
had suddenly stopped beating. \'93A sailor?\'94 he cried out. \'93Did you say a\
sailor?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on\
both arms, and that kind of thing.\'94\
\
\'93Was there anything found on him?\'94 said Dorian, leaning forward and\
looking at the man with startled eyes. \'93Anything that would tell his\
name?\'94\
\
\'93Some money, sir\'97not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any\
kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we\
think.\'94\
\
Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He\
clutched at it madly. \'93Where is the body?\'94 he exclaimed. \'93Quick! I must\
see it at once.\'94\
\
\'93It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don\'92t like to\
have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad\
luck.\'94\
\
\'93The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to\
bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I\'92ll go to the stables myself. It\
will save time.\'94\
\
In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the\
long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him\
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his\
path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.\
He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air\
like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.\
\
At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.\
He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the\
farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him\
that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand\
upon the latch.\
\
There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a\
discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the\
door open and entered.\
\
On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man\
dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted\
handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a\
bottle, sputtered beside it.\
\
Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take\
the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to\
come to him.\
\
\'93Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,\'94 he said, clutching at\
the door-post for support.\
\
When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy\
broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James\
Vane.\
\
He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode\
home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIX.\
\
\
\'93There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,\'94 cried\
Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled\
with rose-water. \'93You are quite perfect. Pray, don\'92t change.\'94\
\
Dorian Gray shook his head. \'93No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\
things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good\
actions yesterday.\'94\
\
\'93Where were you yesterday?\'94\
\
\'93In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.\'94\
\
\'93My dear boy,\'94 said Lord Henry, smiling, \'93anybody can be good in the\
country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people\
who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not\
by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by\
which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being\
corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they\
stagnate.\'94\
\
\'93Culture and corruption,\'94 echoed Dorian. \'93I have known something of\
both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found\
together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I\
have altered.\'94\
\
\'93You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you\
had done more than one?\'94 asked his companion as he spilled into his\
plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a\
perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.\
\
\'93I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.\
I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She\
was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was\
that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don\'92t you?\
How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of\
course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I\
am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we\
have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a\
week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept\
tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone\
away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her\
as flowerlike as I had found her.\'94\
\
\'93I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill\
of real pleasure, Dorian,\'94 interrupted Lord Henry. \'93But I can finish\
your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That\
was the beginning of your reformation.\'94\
\
\'93Harry, you are horrible! You mustn\'92t say these dreadful things.\
Hetty\'92s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But\
there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her\
garden of mint and marigold.\'94\
\
\'93And weep over a faithless Florizel,\'94 said Lord Henry, laughing, as he\
leaned back in his chair. \'93My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\
boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now\
with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to\
a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met\
you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will\
be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much\
of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,\
how do you know that Hetty isn\'92t floating at the present moment in some\
starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the\
most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don\'92t care what\
you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I\
rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,\
like a spray of jasmine. Don\'92t let us talk about it any more, and don\'92t\
try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,\
the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a\
sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me\
something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to\
the club for days.\'94\
\
\'93The people are still discussing poor Basil\'92s disappearance.\'94\
\
\'93I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,\'94 said\
Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.\
\
\'93My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\
the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having\
more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate\
lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell\'92s\
suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.\
Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left\
for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor\
Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris\
at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has\
been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who\
disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful\
city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.\'94\
\
\'93What do you think has happened to Basil?\'94 asked Dorian, holding up his\
Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could\
discuss the matter so calmly.\
\
\'93I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is\
no business of mine. If he is dead, I don\'92t want to think about him.\
Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94 said the younger man wearily.\
\
\'93Because,\'94 said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\
trellis of an open vinaigrette box, \'93one can survive everything\
nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the\
nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee\
in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with\
whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was\
very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,\
married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the\
loss even of one\'92s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.\
They are such an essential part of one\'92s personality.\'94\
\
Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\
room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\
and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he\
stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, \'93Harry, did it ever\
occur to you that Basil was murdered?\'94\
\
Lord Henry yawned. \'93Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury\
watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to\
have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a\
man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was\
really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he\
told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you\
were the dominant motive of his art.\'94\
\
\'93I was very fond of Basil,\'94 said Dorian with a note of sadness in his\
voice. \'93But don\'92t people say that he was murdered?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all\
probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not\
the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his\
chief defect.\'94\
\
\'93What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?\'94\
said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.\
\
\'93I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\
doesn\'92t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\
It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your\
vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs\
exclusively to the lower orders. I don\'92t blame them in the smallest\
degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply\
a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.\'94\
\
\'93A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who\
has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?\
Don\'92t tell me that.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,\'94 cried Lord\
Henry, laughing. \'93That is one of the most important secrets of life. I\
should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should\
never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us\
pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a\
really romantic end as you suggest, but I can\'92t. I dare say he fell\
into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\
scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on\
his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating\
over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don\'92t\
think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years\
his painting had gone off very much.\'94\
\
Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began\
to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\
bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\
perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of\
crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\
and forwards.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\
his pocket; \'93his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have\
lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be\
great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated\
you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It\'92s a habit\
bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he\
did of you? I don\'92t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!\
I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to\
Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got\
it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted\
to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil\'92s best period. Since\
then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good\
intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative\
British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.\'94\
\
\'93I forget,\'94 said Dorian. \'93I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.\
I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why\
do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some\
play\'97Hamlet, I think\'97how do they run?\'97\
\
\'93Like the painting of a sorrow,\
A face without a heart.\'94\
\
\
Yes: that is what it was like.\'94\
\
Lord Henry laughed. \'93If a man treats life artistically, his brain is\
his heart,\'94 he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.\
\
Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\
\'93\'91Like the painting of a sorrow,\'92\'94 he repeated, \'93\'91a face without a\
heart.\'92\'94\
\
The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. \'93By the\
way, Dorian,\'94 he said after a pause, \'93\'91what does it profit a man if he\
gain the whole world and lose\'97how does the quotation run?\'97his own\
soul\'92?\'94\
\
The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.\
\'93Why do you ask me that, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93My dear fellow,\'94 said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,\
\'93I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.\
That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the\
Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people\
listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the\
man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being\
rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A\
wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly\
white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful\
phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips\'97it was really very\
good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet\
that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he\
would not have understood me.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and\
sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is\
a soul in each one of us. I know it.\'94\
\
\'93Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?\'94\
\
\'93Quite sure.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely\
certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the\
lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don\'92t be so serious. What have\
you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up\
our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,\
and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your\
youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you\
are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,\
Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You\
remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,\
and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in\
appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth\
I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,\
or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It\'92s absurd to talk\
of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen\
now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in\
front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the\
aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask\
them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly\
give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,\
believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that\
thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,\
with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against\
the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that\
there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don\'92t stop. I want\
music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I\
am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that\
even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is\
old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.\
Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You\
have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against\
your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to\
you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are\
still the same.\'94\
\
\'93I am not the same, Harry.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.\
Don\'92t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.\
Don\'92t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need\
not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don\'92t deceive\
yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question\
of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides\
itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and\
think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a\
morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that\
brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you\
had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had\
ceased to play\'97I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that\
our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own\
senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of\
_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the\
strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places\
with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has\
always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of\
what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am\
so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or\
painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has\
been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your\
sonnets.\'94\
\
Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.\
\'93Yes, life has been exquisite,\'94 he murmured, \'93but I am not going to\
have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant\
things to me. You don\'92t know everything about me. I think that if you\
did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don\'92t laugh.\'94\
\
\'93Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne\
over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the\
dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she\
will come closer to the earth. You won\'92t? Let us go to the club, then.\
It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is\
some one at White\'92s who wants immensely to know you\'97young Lord Poole,\
Bournemouth\'92s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has\
begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather\
reminds me of you.\'94\
\
\'93I hope not,\'94 said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. \'93But I am tired\
to-night, Harry. I shan\'92t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I\
want to go to bed early.\'94\
\
\'93Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was\
something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than\
I had ever heard from it before.\'94\
\
\'93It is because I am going to be good,\'94 he answered, smiling. \'93I am a\
little changed already.\'94\
\
\'93You cannot change to me, Dorian,\'94 said Lord Henry. \'93You and I will\
always be friends.\'94\
\
\'93Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.\
Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It\
does harm.\'94\
\
\'93My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be\
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people\
against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too\
delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we\
are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,\
there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It\
annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that\
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\
That is all. But we won\'92t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I\
am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you\
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and\
wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.\
Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she\
never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you\
would be. Her clever tongue gets on one\'92s nerves. Well, in any case, be\
here at eleven.\'94\
\
\'93Must I really come, Harry?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don\'92t think there have been\
such lilacs since the year I met you.\'94\
\
\'93Very well. I shall be here at eleven,\'94 said Dorian. \'93Good night,\
Harry.\'94 As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had\
something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.\
\

\
CHAPTER XX.\
\
\
It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\
did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,\
smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He\
heard one of them whisper to the other, \'93That is Dorian Gray.\'94 He\
remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\
at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the\
charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that\
no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to\
love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her\
once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that\
wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she\
had!\'97just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her\
cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had\
everything that he had lost.\
\
When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent\
him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\
\
Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing\
for the unstained purity of his boyhood\'97his rose-white boyhood, as Lord\
Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled\
his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had\
been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in\
being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been\
the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.\
But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?\
\
Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\
the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\
unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to\
that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\
swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not\
\'93Forgive us our sins\'94 but \'93Smite us for our iniquities\'94 should be the\
prayer of man to a most just God.\
\
The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\
laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night\
of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and\
with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some\
one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending\
with these idolatrous words: \'93The world is changed because you are made\
of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.\'94 The\
phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to\
himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the\
floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his\
beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed\
for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from\
stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.\
What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow\
moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had\
spoiled him.\
\
It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It\
was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane\
was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had\
shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\
secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,\
over Basil Hallward\'92s disappearance would soon pass away. It was\
already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the\
death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the\
living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the\
portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It\
was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him\
that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The\
murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,\
his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was\
nothing to him.\
\
A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.\
Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at\
any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.\
\
As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\
the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it\
had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\
every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had\
already gone away. He would go and look.\
\
He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the\
door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\
and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and\
the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\
to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\
\
He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\
dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and\
indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the\
eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\
the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome\'97more loathsome, if\
possible, than before\'97and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\
brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it\
been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the\
desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\
laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\
finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the\
red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a\
horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the\
painted feet, as though the thing had dripped\'97blood even on the hand\
that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to\
confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt\
that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would\
believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\
Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned\
what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\
They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his\
duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.\
There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well\
as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had\
told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of\
Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty\
Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he\
was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing\
more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At\
least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing\
more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the\
mask of goodness. For curiosity\'92s sake he had tried the denial of self.\
He recognized that now.\
\
But this murder\'97was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be\
burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only\
one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself\'97that was\
evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had\
given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had\
felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been\
away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon\
it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had\
marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it\
had been conscience. He would destroy it.\
\
He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He\
had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was\
bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill\
the painter\'92s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,\
and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous\
soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He\
seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\
\
There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its\
agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\
up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and\
brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no\
answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all\
dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and\
watched.\
\
\'93Whose house is that, Constable?\'94 asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\
\
\'93Mr. Dorian Gray\'92s, sir,\'94 answered the policeman.\
\
They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of\
them was Sir Henry Ashton\'92s uncle.\
\
Inside, in the servants\'92 part of the house, the half-clad domestics\
were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\
and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.\
\
After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\
footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They\
called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force\
the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The\
windows yielded easily\'97their bolts were old.\
\
When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\
of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\
exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\
evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,\
and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings\
that they recognized who it was.\

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm\

Defect you cause.\
\
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\
from people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\
www.gutenberg.org\
\
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation\
\
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\
\
The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website\
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\
\
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\
\
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\
volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\
edition.\
\
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\
facility: www.gutenberg.org\
\
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\

   [Illustration: Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents]\
\
                                   I.\
\
                           PLAYING PILGRIMS.\
\
\
"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying\
on the rug.\
\
"It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\
dress.\
\
"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things,\
and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured\
sniff.\
\
"We've got father and mother and each other," said Beth contentedly,\
from her corner.\
\
The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\
cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,--\
\
"We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time." She\
didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of\
father far away, where the fighting was.\
\
Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,--\
\
"You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this\
Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and\
she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are\
suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little\
sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;" and Meg\
shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she\
wanted.\
\
"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've\
each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\
that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\
to buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long," said\
Jo, who was a bookworm.\
\
"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh,\
which no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\
\
"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,"\
said Amy decidedly.\
\
"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\
give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\
I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels\
of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\
\
"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\
I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone\
again.\
\
"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you\
like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\
you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\
fly out of the window or cry?"\
\
"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\
tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\
so stiff, I can't practise well at all;" and Beth looked at her rough\
hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\
\
"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy; "for you don't\
have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\
know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\
he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice."\
\
"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\
papa was a pickle-bottle," advised Jo, laughing.\
\
"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\
proper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_," returned Amy,\
with dignity.\
\
"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\
papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\
if we had no worries!" said Meg, who could remember better times.\
\
"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\
King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\
spite of their money."\
\
"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\
we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say."\
\
"Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\
the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\
hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\
\
"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!"\
\
"That's why I do it."\
\
"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!"\
\
"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"\
\
"'Birds in their little nests agree,'" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\
such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\
"pecking" ended for that time.\
\
"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg, beginning to\
lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. "You are old enough to leave off\
boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\
when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\
hair, you should remember that you are a young lady."\
\
"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\
tails till I'm twenty," cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\
a chestnut mane. "I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\
March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\
enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\
manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\
worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\
only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!" And Jo shook the\
blue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\
bounded across the room.\
\
"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\
contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\
girls," said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\
all the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\
its touch.\
\
"As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether too particular and\
prim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\
goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\
of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\
as bad as Jo's slang."\
\
"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?" asked Beth,\
ready to share the lecture.\
\
"You're a dear, and nothing else," answered Meg warmly; and no one\
contradicted her, for the "Mouse" was the pet of the family.\
\
As young readers like to know "how people look," we will take this\
moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\
knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\
without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\
old room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\
a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\
chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\
pleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.\
\
Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\
plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\
mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\
Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\
never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\
much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\
gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\
funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\
was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\
had Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\
uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\
woman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\
her--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\
manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\
disturbed. Her father called her "Little Tranquillity," and the name\
suited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\
own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\
though the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\
least. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\
on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\
young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\
sisters were we will leave to be found out.\
\
The clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\
of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\
effect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\
to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\
of the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\
as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\
\
        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\
\
"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair."\
\
"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar," said Beth.\
\
"No, I shall!" cried Amy.\
\
"I'm the oldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\
\
"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\
slippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\
gone."\
\
"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Beth; "let's each get her something\
for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves."\
\
"That's like you, dear! What will we get?" exclaimed Jo.\
\
Every one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\
idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, "I shall give\
her a nice pair of gloves."\
\
"Army shoes, best to be had," cried Jo.\
\
"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Beth.\
\
"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\
much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils," added Amy.\
\
"How will we give the things?" asked Meg.\
\
"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\
Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?" answered Jo.\
\
        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\
                     turn to sit in the big chair]\
\
"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big\
chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\
presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\
dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles," said\
Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\
\
"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\
her. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\
do about the play for Christmas night," said Jo, marching up and down,\
with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\
\
"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\
such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\
"dressing-up" frolics.\
\
"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\
with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\
actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\
boards," said Jo. "We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\
the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that."\
\
"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\
myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down\
easily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\
graceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol," returned\
Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\
was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\
\
          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\
\
"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\
crying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'" and away went Jo,\
with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\
\
Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\
herself along as if she went by machinery; and her "Ow!" was more\
suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\
a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\
burn as she watched the fun, with interest.\
\
"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\
audience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg."\
\
Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of\
two pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful\
incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;\
Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of\
remorse and arsenic, with a wild "Ha! ha!"\
\
"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\
rubbed his elbows.\
\
"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're\
a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\
sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\
\
"Not quite," replied Jo modestly. "I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\
Operatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\
if we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\
part. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'" muttered Jo, rolling her\
eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\
\
"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\
bread. Beth's stage-struck!" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\
general burst of laughter.\
\
"Glad to find you so merry, my girls," said a cheery voice at the door,\
and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a\
"can-I-help-you" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\
elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\
gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\
the world.\
\
"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\
getting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\
dinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\
tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby."\
\
While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,\
her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to\
her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls\
flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\
arranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\
overturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\
fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\
directions to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\
\
As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\
happy face, "I've got a treat for you after supper."\
\
A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped\
her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her\
napkin, crying, "A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!"\
\
"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\
the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving\
wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls," said Mrs.\
March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\
\
"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\
over your plate, Amy," cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\
bread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\
treat.\
\
Beth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\
over the delight to come, till the others were ready.\
\
"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\
too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier," said Meg\
warmly.\
\
"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\
nurse, so I could be near him and help him," exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\
\
"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\
bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug," sighed Amy.\
\
"When will he come home, Marmee?" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\
her voice.\
\
"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\
work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\
minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter."\
\
They all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\
feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\
the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\
should happen to be touching.\
\
Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not\
touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little\
was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\
homesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\
lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\
at the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\
longing for the little girls at home.\
\
           [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\
\
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\
day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\
at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\
remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\
need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\
they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\
fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\
beautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\
than ever of my little women."\
\
Everybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\
great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\
the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\
and sobbed out, "I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\
so he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by."\
\
"We all will!" cried Meg. "I think too much of my looks, and hate to\
work, but won't any more, if I can help it."\
\
"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\
rough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\
else," said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\
harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\
\
Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\
began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\
lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\
that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\
coming home.\
\
        [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]\
\
Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\
cheery voice, "Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress\
when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me\
tie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks\
and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the\
cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,\
where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\
Celestial City."\
\
"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\
passing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!" said Jo.\
\
"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,"\
said Meg.\
\
"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our\
flowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for\
joy up there in the sunshine," said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant\
moment had come back to her.\
\
"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\
and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\
top. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\
over again," said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\
at the mature age of twelve.\
\
"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\
playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\
road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\
guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\
which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\
begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\
before father comes home."\
\
"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?" asked Amy, who was a very\
literal young lady.\
\
"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\
think she hasn't got any," said her mother.\
\
"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\
pianos, and being afraid of people."\
\
Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\
nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\
\
"Let us do it," said Meg thoughtfully. "It is only another name for\
trying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\
be good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best."\
\
"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled\
us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,\
like Christian. What shall we do about that?" asked Jo, delighted with\
the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her\
duty.\
\
"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your\
guide-book," replied Mrs. March.\
\
They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then\
out came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls\
made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no\
one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into\
four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\
and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the\
different countries as they stitched their way through them.\
\
   [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\
                                 piano]\
\
At nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.\
No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a\
way of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant\
accompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a\
flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a\
cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\
coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the\
most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could\
lisp\
\
        "Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,"\
\
and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\
The first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the\
house singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same\
cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\
lullaby.\
\
      [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]\

                   [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]\
\
                                   II.\
\
                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\
\
\
Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\
stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\
disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\
it was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\
promise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\
crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\
old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\
guide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\
"Merry Christmas," and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\
green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\
words written by their mother, which made their one present very\
precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\
their little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\
looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\
coming day.\
\
In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\
which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\
very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\
\
"Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\
the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, "mother wants us to\
read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\
to be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\
trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\
please; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\
every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\
me through the day."\
\
Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\
her, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\
so seldom seen on her restless face.\
\
"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\
hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,"\
whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\
example.\
\
"I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\
while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\
touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\
\
"Where is mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\
their gifts, half an hour later.\
\
"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\
straight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\
givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin'," replied Hannah, who\
had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\
all more as a friend than a servant.\
\
"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\
ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\
basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\
"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?" she added, as the little flask\
did not appear.\
\
"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\
it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\
first stiffness off the new army-slippers.\
\
"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed\
them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth, looking proudly\
at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\
\
"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\
March.' How funny!" cried Jo, taking up one.\
\
"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\
initials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,"\
said Beth, looking troubled.\
\
"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\
no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know," said\
Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\
\
"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\
and steps sounded in the hall.\
\
Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\
all waiting for her.\
\
"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?" asked Meg,\
surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\
early.\
\
"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\
came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\
_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\
more."\
\
As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\
one; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\
herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her "a\
trump," while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\
ornament the stately bottle.\
\
"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\
being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\
minute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now."\
\
Another bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\
girls to the table, eager for breakfast.\
\
"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read\
some, and mean to every day," they cried, in chorus.\
\
"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope\
you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far\
away from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six\
children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\
no fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\
tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give\
them your breakfast as a Christmas present?"\
\
They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\
minute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\
\
"I'm so glad you came before we began!"\
\
"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?" asked\
Beth, eagerly.\
\
"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins," added Amy, heroically giving\
up the articles she most liked.\
\
Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\
big plate.\
\
"I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. "You\
shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\
milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time."\
\
They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was\
early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\
no one laughed at the queer party.\
\
                 [Illustration: The procession set out]\
\
A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\
ragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\
hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\
\
How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!\
\
"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!" said the poor woman,\
crying for joy.\
\
"Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them laughing.\
\
In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\
there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\
broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother\
tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\
dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The\
girls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\
fed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\
understand the funny broken English.\
\
"Das ist gut!" "Die Engel-kinder!" cried the poor things, as they ate,\
and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.\
\
The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\
very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a "Sancho" ever\
since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\
get any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\
there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\
little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\
with bread and milk on Christmas morning.\
\
"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it," said\
Meg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\
collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\
\
Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\
the few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\
chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\
quite an elegant air to the table.\
\
"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for\
Marmee!" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to\
the seat of honor.\
\
Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\
escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\
and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\
little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\
handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\
cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\
pronounced a "perfect fit."\
\
There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\
simple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\
the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\
work.\
\
The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\
the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being\
still too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\
afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\
wits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\
whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\
productions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\
butter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\
glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\
with the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\
of tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\
turned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\
revels.\
\
No gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\
content, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\
given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\
an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\
picture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\
smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\
to take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\
for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\
whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\
It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\
employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\
spent in less profitable society.\
\
On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\
dress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\
most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\
and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\
occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\
excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\
apart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.\
\
"A gloomy wood," according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\
few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\
distance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\
for walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\
on it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\
glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\
from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\
for the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\
a clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\
cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\
struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\
hatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\
kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\
occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\
and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\
the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\
ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding "What ho, minion! I need\
thee!"\
\
[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\
\
Out came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\
black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\
a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\
a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\
spirit who would bring the love philter:--\
\
        "Hither, hither, from thy home,\
         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\
         Born of roses, fed on dew,\
         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\
         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\
         The fragrant philter which I need;\
         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\
         Spirit, answer now my song!"\
\
            [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]\
\
A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\
appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\
hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--\
\
         "Hither I come,\
          From my airy home,\
        Afar in the silver moon.\
          Take the magic spell,\
          And use it well,\
        Or its power will vanish soon!"\
\
And, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\
vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\
lovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\
croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\
mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\
boots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\
killed a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\
intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain\
fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\
of the play.\
\
A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when\
it became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got\
up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to\
the ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,\
and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver\
dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,\
red cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.\
Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.\
Zara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came\
the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five\
steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she\
crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was\
about to leap gracefully down, when, "Alas! alas for Zara!" she forgot\
her train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,\
fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!\
\
A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\
wreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, "I told you so! I told you\
so!" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed\
in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--\
\
"Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!"--and, ordering Roderigo up,\
banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\
shaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\
gentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she\
also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\
of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them\
away, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech\
he ought to have made.\
\
Act third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to\
free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees\
him put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little\
servant "Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall\
come anon." The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and\
Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,\
the "minion," carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\
the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long\
warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching\
and stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has\
done in a song of exquisite power and melody.\
\
This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought\
that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred\
the effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and\
with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was\
considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put\
together.\
\
Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\
himself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\
the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\
informing him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if\
he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\
rapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his\
lady-love.\
\
Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\
wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a\
touching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands\
her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\
gesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to\
bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a\
letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The\
latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\
pair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The\
bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the\
stage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely\
softens the "stern sire": he consents without a murmur, all join in a\
joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive\
Don Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\
\
  [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing]\
\
Tumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the\
cot-bed, on which the "dress-circle" was built, suddenly shut up, and\
extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\
the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\
with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,\
with "Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\
supper."\
\
This was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,\
they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to\
get up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was\
unheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was\
ice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and\
fruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,\
four great bouquets of hot-house flowers!\
\
It quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and\
then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\
\
"Is it fairies?" asked Amy,\
\
"It's Santa Claus," said Beth.\
\
"Mother did it"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard\
and white eyebrows.\
\
"Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper," cried Jo, with a\
sudden inspiration.\
\
"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.\
\
"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into\
his head? We don't know him!" exclaimed Meg.\
\
"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\
odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;\
and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\
allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\
them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you\
have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\
breakfast."\
\
"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,\
and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us;\
but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when\
we pass," said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt\
out of sight, with "Ohs!" and "Ahs!" of satisfaction.\
\
"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?"\
asked one of the girls. "My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's\
very proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his\
grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and\
makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't\
come. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls."\
\
"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\
fence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so\
on,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some\
day; for he needs fun, I'm sure he does," said Jo decidedly.\
\
                [Illustration: We talked over the fence]\
\
"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I've no\
objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought\
the flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure\
what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\
hearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own."\
\
"It's a mercy you didn't, mother!" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\
"But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps\
he'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?"\
\
"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!" And Meg\
examined her flowers with great interest.\
\
"They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me," said Mrs.\
March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\
\
Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, "I wish I could send my\
bunch to father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we\
are."\

\
                           THE LAURENCE BOY.\
\
\
"Jo! Jo! where are you?" cried Meg, at the foot of the garret stairs.\
\
"Here!" answered a husky voice from above; and, running up, Meg found\
her sister eating apples and crying over the "Heir of Redclyffe,"\
wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny\
window. This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\
half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\
of a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\
appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\
cheeks, and waited to hear the news.\
\
"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\
to-morrow night!" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\
proceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\
\
"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\
little dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\
what _shall_ we wear?"\
\
"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\
because we haven't got anything else?" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\
\
"If I only had a silk!" sighed Meg. "Mother says I may when I'm\
eighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait."\
\
"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\
Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\
Whatever shall I do? the burn shows badly, and I can't take any out."\
\
"You must sit still all you can, and keep your back out of sight; the\
front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\
will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\
my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like."\
\
"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall\
have to go without," said Jo, who never troubled herself much about\
dress.\
\
"You _must_ have gloves, or I won't go," cried Meg decidedly. "Gloves\
are more important than anything else; you can't dance without them, and\
if you don't I should be _so_ mortified."\
\
"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing; it's no\
fun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers."\
\
"You can't ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\
so careless. She said, when you spoilt the others, that she shouldn't\
get you any more this winter. Can't you make them do?" asked Meg\
anxiously.\
\
"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained\
they are; that's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage--each\
wear one good one and carry a bad one; don't you see?"\
\
"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\
dreadfully," began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\
\
"Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!" cried Jo, taking\
up her book.\
\
"You may have it, you may! only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.\
Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher\
Columbus!' will you?"\
\
"Don't worry about me; I'll be as prim as I can, and not get into any\
scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me\
finish this splendid story."\
\
So Meg went away to "accept with thanks," look over her dress, and sing\
blithely as she did up her one real lace frill; while Jo finished her\
story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\
\
On New-Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\
played dressing-maids, and the two elder were absorbed in the\
all-important business of "getting ready for the party." Simple as the\
toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\
and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the\
house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch\
the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\
\
        [Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]\
\
"Ought they to smoke like that?" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.\
\
"It's the dampness drying," replied Jo.\
\
"What a queer smell! it's like burnt feathers," observed Amy, smoothing\
her own pretty curls with a superior air.\
\
"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\
ringlets," said Jo, putting down the tongs.\
\
She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\
hair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of\
little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\
\
"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\
my hair!" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\
forehead.\
\
"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\
everything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\
mess," groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\
regret.\
\
"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\
on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\
seen many girls do it so," said Amy consolingly.\
\
"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,"\
cried Meg petulantly.\
\
"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,"\
said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\
\
After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\
united exertions of the family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on.\
They looked very well in their simple suits,--Meg in silvery drab, with\
a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with\
a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for\
her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one\
soiled one, and all pronounced the effect "quite easy and fine." Meg's\
high-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not\
own it, and Jo's nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her\
head, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant\
or die!\
\
"Have a good time, dearies!" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\
daintily down the walk. "Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven,\
when I send Hannah for you." As the gate clashed behind them, a voice\
cried from a window,--\
\
"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?"\
\
"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo, adding,\
with a laugh, as they went on, "I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\
were all running away from an earthquake."\
\
"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady\
is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief," replied Meg,\
who had a good many little "aristocratic tastes" of her own.\
\
"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\
right? and does my hair look _very_ bad?" said Meg, as she turned from\
the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing-room, after a prolonged prink.\
\
"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind\
me by a wink, will you?" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her\
head a hasty brush.\
\
"No, winking isn't lady-like; I'll lift my eyebrows if anything is\
wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,\
and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to any\
one: it isn't the thing."\
\
"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music\
gay?"\
\
             [Illustration: Mrs. Gardiner greeted them]\
\
Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties,\
and, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them.\
Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them\
over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\
ease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\
gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\
as much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\
lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\
longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\
She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\
that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\
group near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\
roam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\
stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\
at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\
have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\
red-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\
her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\
herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\
same refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\
to face with the "Laurence boy."\
\
           [Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\
\
"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!" stammered Jo, preparing to\
back out as speedily as she had bounced in.\
\
But the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\
startled,--\
\
"Don't mind me; stay, if you like."\
\
"Sha'n't I disturb you?"\
\
"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\
rather strange at first, you know."\
\
"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather."\
\
The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\
be polite and easy,--\
\
"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\
don't you?"\
\
"Next door"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\
was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\
when he brought the cat home.\
\
That put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\
heartiest way,--\
\
"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present."\
\
"Grandpa sent it."\
\
"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?"\
\
"How is your cat, Miss March?" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\
while his black eyes shone with fun.\
\
"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,"\
returned the young lady.\
\
"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie."\
\
"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!"\
\
"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\
me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead."\
\
"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\
instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?"\
\
"I thrashed 'em."\
\
"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it"; and\
Jo resigned herself with a sigh.\
\
"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?" asked Laurie, looking as if he\
thought the name suited her.\
\
"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and every one is\
lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\
people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief, and\
let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?"\
\
"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\
into company enough yet to know how you do things here."\
\
"Abroad!" cried Jo. "Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\
describe their travels."\
\
Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\
set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\
the boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\
holiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\
\
"Don't I wish I'd been there!" cried Jo. "Did you go to Paris?"\
\
"We spent last winter there."\
\
"Can you talk French?"\
\
"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay."\
\
"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce."\
\
"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?" said Laurie\
good-naturedly.\
\
"How nicely you do it! Let me see,--you said, 'Who is the young lady in\
the pretty slippers,' didn't you?"\
\
"Oui, mademoiselle."\
\
"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is\
pretty?"\
\
"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\
quiet, and dances like a lady."\
\
Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\
stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,\
till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\
off; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\
Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\
lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the "Laurence boy" better than\
ever, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\
to the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\
were almost unknown creatures to them.\
\
"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\
teeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\
and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?"\
\
It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask; but she checked herself in\
time, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way.\
\
"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your\
books,--no, I mean studying hard"; and Jo blushed at the dreadful\
"pegging" which had escaped her.\
\
Laurie smiled, but didn't seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,--\
\
"Not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway."\
\
"Aren't you but fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\
had imagined seventeen already.\
\
"Sixteen, next month."\
\
"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it."\
\
"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way\
fellows do either, in this country."\
\
"What do you like?"\
\
"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."\
\
Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows\
looked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by\
saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a splendid polka! Why don't you\
go and try it?"\
\
"If you will come too," he answered, with a gallant little bow.\
\
"I can't; for I told Meg I wouldn't, because--" There Jo stopped, and\
looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\
\
"Because what?" asked Laurie curiously.\
\
"You won't tell?"\
\
"Never!"\
\
"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\
frocks, and I scorched this one; and, though it's nicely mended, it\
shows, and Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You may\
laugh, if you want to; it is funny, I know."\
\
But Laurie didn't laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the\
expression of his face puzzled Jo, when he said very gently,--\
\
"Never mind that; I'll tell you how we can manage: there's a long hall\
out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please\
come?"\
\
Jo thanked him, and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when\
she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was\
empty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\
her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\
When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\
and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\
Heidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\
Jo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\
sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\
\
              [Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\
\
"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\
wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\
going to get home," she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\
\
"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I\
don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\
night," answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\
\
"I can't have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I\
can't get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it's a long\
way to the stable, and no one to send."\
\
"I'll go."\
\
"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for\
the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest\
till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."\
\
"I'll ask Laurie; he will go," said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\
occurred to her.\
\
"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these\
slippers with our things. I can't dance any more; but as soon as supper\
is over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes."\
\
"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather."\
\
"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't\
stir!"\
\
So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\
to the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and\
opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little\
private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\
which she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\
bad as the back.\
\
"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\
by scrubbing her gown with it.\
\
"Can I help you?" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a\
full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\
\
"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and some one\
shook me; and here I am, in a nice state," answered Jo, glancing\
dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\
\
"Too bad! I was looking for some one to give this to. May I take it to\
your sister?"\
\
"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it\
myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did."\
\
Jo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\
little table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and\
was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a "nice boy."\
They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the\
midst of a quiet game of "Buzz," with two or three other young people\
who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose\
so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation\
of pain.\
\
"Hush! Don't say anything," she whispered, adding aloud, "It's nothing.\
I turned my foot a little, that's all"; and limped up-stairs to put her\
things on.\
\
Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\
decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,\
and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\
happened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;\
and Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she\
said, came up, and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\
come for him, he said.\
\
"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?" began Jo, looking relieved,\
but hesitating to accept the offer.\
\
"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It's all\
on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."\
\
That settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\
accepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah\
hated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they\
rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\
elegant. Laurie went on the box; so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\
girls talked over their party in freedom.\
\
"I had a capital time. Did you?" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\
making herself comfortable.\
\
"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to\
me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her, when Sallie does.\
She is going in the spring, when the opera comes; and it will be\
perfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go," answered Meg, cheering\
up at the thought.\
\
"I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from. Was he\
nice?"\
\
"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red; and he was very polite, and I\
had a delicious redowa with him."\
\
"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit, when he did the new step. Laurie\
and I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?"\
\
"No; but it was very rude. What _were_ you about all that time, hidden\
away there?"\
\
Jo told her adventures, and, by the time she had finished, they were at\
home. With many thanks, they said "Good night," and crept in, hoping to\
disturb no one; but the instant their door creaked, two little\
night-caps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out,--\
\
"Tell about the party! tell about the party!"\
\
With what Meg called "a great want of manners," Jo had saved some\
bonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the\
most thrilling events of the evening.\
\
"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\
from the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown, with a maid\
to wait on me," said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica, and\
brushed her hair.\
\
"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\
do, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight\
slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them."\
And I think Jo was quite right.\
\
                  [Illustration: Tell about the party]\
\
\
\
\
     [Illustration: The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach]\
\
                                  IV.\
\
                                BURDENS.\
\
\
"Oh dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on," sighed\
Meg, the morning after the party; for, now the holidays were over, the\
week of merry-making did not fit her for going on easily with the task\
she never liked.\
\
"I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time; wouldn't it be fun?"\
answered Jo, yawning dismally.\
\
"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\
seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and\
drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people,\
you know, and I always envy girls who do such things; I'm so fond of\
luxury," said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the\
least shabby.\
\
"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble, but shoulder our\
bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt\
March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\
learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so\
light that I sha'n't mind her."\
\
This idea tickled Jo's fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg\
didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,\
seemed heavier than ever. She hadn't heart enough even to make herself\
pretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her\
hair in the most becoming way.\
\
"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\
midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?" she muttered,\
shutting her drawer with a jerk. "I shall have to toil and moil all my\
days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\
and sour, because I'm poor, and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\
It's a shame!"\
\
So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\
at breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to\
croak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\
herself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her\
lessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers; Jo _would_\
whistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy\
trying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the\
grumps, for being up late didn't suit her.\
\
"There never _was_ such a cross family!" cried Jo, losing her temper\
when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot-lacings, and sat down\
upon her hat.\
\
"You're the crossest person in it!" returned Amy, washing out the sum,\
that was all wrong, with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\
\
"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\
drowned," exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten,\
which had scrambled up her back, and stuck like a burr just out of\
reach.\
\
Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed, because she\
couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.\
\
"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I _must_ get this off by the\
early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry," cried Mrs.\
March, crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter.\
\
There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\
hot turn-overs on the table, and stalked out again. These turn-overs\
were an institution; and the girls called them "muffs," for they had no\
others, and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold\
mornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy\
she might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor things got no\
other lunch, and were seldom home before two.\
\
"Cuddle your cats, and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee;\
we are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular\
angels. Now then, Meg!" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\
were not setting out as they ought to do.\
\
They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\
always at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\
Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\
that; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\
motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\
\
"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\
serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\
seen," cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\
bitter wind.\
\
"Don't use such dreadful expressions," said Meg, from the depths of the\
vail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\
\
"I like good strong words, that mean something," replied Jo, catching\
her hat as it took a leap off her head, preparatory to flying away\
altogether.\
\
"Call yourself any names you like; but _I_ am neither a rascal nor a\
wretch, and I don't choose to be called so."\
\
"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross to-day because you can't\
sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make\
my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and\
high-heeled slippers and posies and red-headed boys to dance with."\
\
"How ridiculous you are, Jo!" but Meg laughed at the nonsense, and felt\
better in spite of herself.\
\
"Lucky for you I am; for if I put on crushed airs, and tried to be\
dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can\
always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but\
come home jolly, there's a dear."\
\
Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for\
the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\
turn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\
hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\
\
When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate\
friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward\
their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too\
early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\
consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\
spite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\
place as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\
said, she _was_ "fond of luxury," and her chief trouble was poverty. She\
found it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\
time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\
of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\
was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\
friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\
all she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\
caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\
lively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\
merry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\
would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\
sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\
she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\
alone can make life happy.\
\
Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\
person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\
of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\
offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\
all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\
unworldly Marches only said,--\
\
"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\
keep together and be happy in one another."\
\
The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\
at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\
the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\
did not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\
appeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\
irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\
marched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\
always cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\
that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\
old lady.\
\
I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,\
which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered\
the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\
with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\
his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\
the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\
tall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\
wilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\
library a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\
was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\
herself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\
travels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\
happiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\
heart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\
adventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, "Josy-phine!\
Josy-phine!" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\
poodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.\
\
          [Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]\
\
Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\
idea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\
her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\
ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\
spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\
of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\
she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\
that she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\
of the perpetual "Josy-phine!"\
\
Beth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she\
suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home,\
with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\
devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\
faithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\
housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\
comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\
loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\
world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\
bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\
Beth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\
whole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\
in; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\
because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\
more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\
dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\
or blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\
most repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\
an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\
belonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\
the rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\
taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\
little cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\
deficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\
this chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\
dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\
laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\
breathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\
went to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, "I\
hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear."\
\
Beth had her troubles as well as the others; and not being an angel, but\
a very human little girl, she often "wept a little weep," as Jo said,\
because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved\
music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\
at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\
hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\
Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\
when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\
never was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\
said hopefully to herself, "I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\
good."\
\
There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\
till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\
sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\
sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.\
\
If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\
would have answered at once, "My nose." When she was a baby, Jo had\
accidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\
fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\
"Petrea's"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\
could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\
and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\
Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\
\
"Little Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for\
drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing\
fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her\
teachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\
slate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\
on; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\
out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\
well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\
deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\
good-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\
Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\
accomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\
crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\
the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, "When papa was rich we did\
so-and-so," which was very touching; and her long words were considered\
"perfectly elegant" by the girls.\
\
Amy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\
small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\
however, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\
clothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\
suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\
unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\
good, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\
afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\
purple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.\
\
"My only comfort," she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, "is, that\
mother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\
Parks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful; for sometimes she is\
so bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When\
I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat\
nose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it."\
\
Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of\
opposites, Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\
thoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\
exercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\
were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\
her keeping, and watched over her in her own way; "playing mother" they\
called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\
the maternal instinct of little women.\
\
"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm\
really dying for some amusement," said Meg, as they sat sewing together\
that evening.\
\
"I had a queer time with aunt to-day, and, as I got the best of it, I'll\
tell you about it," began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. "I was\
reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for\
aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\
fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\
began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\
opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\
\
            [Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\
\
"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\
\
"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\
think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\
finds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\
top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\
and read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I'd just got to\
where they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out\
loud. Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\
to read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\
and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\
she only said,--\
\
"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\
\
"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\
Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\
'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am; sha'n't I stop now?'\
\
"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me\
a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,--\
\
"'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss.'"\
\
"Did she own she liked it?" asked Meg.\
\
"Oh, bless you, no! but she let old Belsham rest; and, when I ran back\
after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that\
she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall, because of the\
good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have, if she only\
chose. I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich\
people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think," added Jo.\
\
"That reminds me," said Meg, "that I've got something to tell. It isn't\
funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came\
home. At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the\
children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and\
papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking\
very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed\
me, so I shouldn't see how red their eyes were. I didn't ask any\
questions, of course; but I felt so sorry for them, and was rather glad\
I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family."\
\
"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than\
anything bad boys can do," said Amy, shaking her head, as if her\
experience of life had been a deep one. "Susie Perkins came to school\
to-day with a lovely red carnelian ring; I wanted it dreadfully, and\
wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr.\
Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies,\
my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were\
laughing over it, when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he\
ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was _parry_lized with fright,\
but she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did? He took her by the\
ear, the ear! just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation\
platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding that slate so\
every one could see."\
\
          [Illustration: He took her by the ear! by the ear!]\
\
"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked Jo, who relished the\
scrape.\
\
"Laugh? Not one! They sat as still as mice; and Susie cried quarts, I\
know she did. I didn't envy her then; for I felt that millions of\
carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy, after that. I never, never\
should have got over such a agonizing mortification." And Amy went on\
with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue, and the successful\
utterance of two long words in a breath.\
\
"I saw something that I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at\
dinner, but I forgot," said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in\
order as she talked. "When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.\
Laurence was in the fish-shop; but he didn't see me, for I kept behind a\
barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter, the fish-man. A poor woman came\
in, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do\
some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her\
children, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a\
hurry, and said 'No,' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking\
hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the\
crooked end of his cane, and held it out to her. She was so glad and\
surprised, she took it right in her arms, and thanked him over and over.\
He told her to 'go along and cook it,' and she hurried off, so happy!\
Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\
slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'"\
\
           [Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]\
\
When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\
and, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\
\
"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\
very anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should\
be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I\
kept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some\
clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked\
poor and tired and anxious.\
\
"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked; for the note he brought was not\
to me.\
\
"'Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and\
I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital,' he\
answered quietly.\
\
"'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said, feeling\
respect now, instead of pity.\
\
"'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any use;\
as I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'\
\
"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give\
his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man, and thought it\
too much, while he gave four, without grudging them. I had all my girls\
to comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say\
'good by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my\
blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\
thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me."\
\
"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this. I like\
to think about them afterwards, if they are real, and not too preachy,"\
said Jo, after a minute's silence.\
\
Mrs. March smiled, and began at once; for she had told stories to this\
little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.\
\
"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and\
drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and\
parents, who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented." (Here\
the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew\
diligently.) "These girls were anxious to be good, and made many\
excellent resolutions; but they did not keep them very well, and were\
constantly saying, 'If we only had this,' or 'If we could only do that,'\
quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things\
they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could\
use to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel discontented, think\
over your blessings, and be grateful.'" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as\
if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not\
done yet.)\
\
"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were\
surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money\
couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses; another\
that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth,\
health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady, who\
couldn't enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as it was to\
help get dinner, it was harder still to have to go begging for it; and\
the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good\
behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings\
already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken\
away entirely, instead of increased; and I believe they were never\
disappointed, or sorry that they took the old woman's advice."\
\
"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories\
against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!" cried Meg.\
\
"I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort father used to tell us," said\
Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.\
\
"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more\
careful than ever now; for I've had warning from Susie's downfall," said\
Amy morally.\
\
"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do, you just say\
to us, as old Chloe did in 'Uncle Tom,' 'Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!\
tink ob yer marcies!'" added Jo, who could not, for the life of her,\
help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took\
it to heart as much as any of them.\

\
"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?" asked Meg, one snowy\
afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber\
boots, old sack and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the\
other.\
\
"Going out for exercise," answered Jo, with a mischievous twinkle in her\
eyes.\
\
"I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It's\
cold and dull out; and I advise you to stay, warm and dry, by the fire,\
as I do," said Meg, with a shiver.\
\
"Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and, not being a pussycat,\
I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm going to\
find some."\
\
Meg went back to toast her feet and read "Ivanhoe"; and Jo began to dig\
paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon\
swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came\
out; and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the\
Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the\
city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large\
gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one\
side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of\
the vines that in summer covered its walls, and the flowers which then\
surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly\
betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach-house\
and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely\
things one caught between the rich curtains. Yet it seemed a lonely,\
lifeless sort of house; for no children frolicked on the lawn, no\
motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and\
out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.\
\
To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace,\
full of splendors and delights, which no one enjoyed. She had long\
wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the "Laurence boy,"\
who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to\
begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had\
planned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been seen\
lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a\
brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden,\
where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.\
\
"That boy is suffering for society and fun," she said to herself. "His\
grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all\
alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young\
and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!"\
\
The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things, and was always\
scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of "going over" was\
not forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try\
what could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sallied out\
to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused, and took a survey.\
All quiet,--curtains down at the lower windows; servants out of sight,\
and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand\
at the upper window.\
\
"There he is," thought Jo, "poor boy! all alone and sick this dismal\
day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snow-ball, and make him look out, and\
then say a kind word to him."\
\
Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a\
face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes\
brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and\
flourished her broom as she called out,--\
\
"How do you do? Are you sick?"\
\
                [Illustration: Laurie opened the window]\
\
Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven,--\
\
"Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week."\
\
"I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?"\
\
"Nothing; it's as dull as tombs up here."\
\
"Don't you read?"\
\
"Not much; they won't let me."\
\
"Can't somebody read to you?"\
\
"Grandpa does, sometimes; but my books don't interest him, and I hate to\
ask Brooke all the time."\
\
"Have some one come and see you, then."\
\
"There isn't any one I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head\
is weak."\
\
"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet,\
and like to play nurse."\
\
"Don't know any."\
\
"You know us," began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.\
\
"So I do! Will you come, please?" cried Laurie.\
\
"I'm not quiet and nice; but I'll come, if mother will let me. I'll go\
ask her. Shut that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come."\
\
With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering\
what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at\
the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as Mrs.\
March said, he was "a little gentleman," and did honor to the coming\
guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying\
to tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen servants, was\
anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided\
voice, asking for "Mr. Laurie," and a surprised-looking servant came\
running up to announce a young lady.\
\
"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo," said Laurie, going to the door\
of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and\
quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three\
kittens in the other.\
\
"Here I am, bag and baggage," she said briskly. "Mother sent her love,\
and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some\
of her blanc-mange; she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats\
would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse,\
she was so anxious to do something."\
\
It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing; for, in\
laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable\
at once.\
\
"That looks too pretty to eat," he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo\
uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc-mange, surrounded by a garland\
of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.\
\
"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly, and wanted to show it.\
Tell the girl to put it away for your tea: it's so simple, you can eat\
it; and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.\
What a cosy room this is!"\
\
"It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don't\
know how to make them mind. It worries me, though."\
\
"I'll right it up in two minutes; for it only needs to have the hearth\
brushed, so,--and the things made straight on the mantel-piece so,--and\
the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the\
light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you're fixed."\
\
And so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things\
into place, and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched\
her in respectful silence; and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat\
down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully,--\
\
"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big\
chair, and let me do something to amuse my company."\
\
"No; I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?" and Jo looked\
affectionately toward some inviting books near by.\
\
"Thank you; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather\
talk," answered Laurie.\
\
"Not a bit; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I\
never know when to stop."\
\
"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal, and sometimes goes\
out with a little basket?" asked Laurie, with interest.\
\
"Yes, that's Beth; she's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too."\
\
"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?"\
\
"How did you find that out?"\
\
Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, "Why, you see, I often hear you\
calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking\
over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg\
your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the\
curtain at the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are\
lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all\
round the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it\
looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't\
got any mother, you know;" and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little\
twitching of the lips that he could not control.\
\
The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.\
She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,\
and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was\
sick and lonely; and, feeling how rich she was in home-love and\
happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very\
friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said,--\
\
"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as\
much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come\
over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and\
Beth would sing to you if _I_ begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg\
and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd\
have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you?"\
\
"I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, though he\
does not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's\
afraid I might be a bother to strangers," began Laurie, brightening more\
and more.\
\
"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be\
a bother. We _want_ to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever\
so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got\
acquainted with all our neighbors but you."\
\
"You see grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what\
happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and\
I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as\
I can."\
\
"That's bad. You ought to make an effort, and go visiting everywhere you\
are asked; then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go\
to. Never mind being bashful; it won't last long if you keep going."\
\
Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of\
bashfulness; for there was so much good-will in Jo, it was impossible\
not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.\
\
"Do you like your school?" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a\
little pause, during which he stared at the fire, and Jo looked about\
her, well pleased.\
\
"Don't go to school; I'm a business man--girl, I mean. I go to wait on\
my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too," answered Jo.\
\
Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question; but remembering just in\
time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's\
affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good\
breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him\
a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot\
that talked Spanish, and the library where she revelled. Laurie enjoyed\
that immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came\
once to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll\
had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and\
laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head\
in to see what was the matter.\
\
                [Illustration: Poll tweaked off his wig]\
\
"Oh! that does me no end of good. Tell on, please," he said, taking his\
face out of the sofa-cushion, red and shining with merriment.\
\
Much elated with her success, Jo did "tell on," all about their plays\
and plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting\
events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to\
talking about books; and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved\
them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\
\
"If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so\
you needn't be afraid," said Laurie, getting up.\
\
"I'm not afraid of anything," returned Jo, with a toss of the head.\
\
"I don't believe you are!" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\
admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be\
a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\
moods.\
\
The atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way\
from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;\
and so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,\
and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined\
with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\
cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and\
queer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,\
with quaint tiles all round it.\
\
"What richness!" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,\
and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. "Theodore\
Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world," she added\
impressively.\
\
"A fellow can't live on books," said Laurie, shaking his head, as he\
perched on a table opposite.\
\
Before he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\
alarm, "Mercy me! it's your grandpa!"\
\
"Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,"\
returned the boy, looking wicked.\
\
"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should\
be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for\
it," said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.\
\
"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only\
afraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I\
couldn't bear to stop," said Laurie gratefully.\
\
"The doctor to see you, sir," and the maid beckoned as she spoke.\
\
"Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,"\
said Laurie.\
\
"Don't mind me. I'm as happy as a cricket here," answered Jo.\
\
Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was\
standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door\
opened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, "I'm sure now\
that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his\
mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.\
He isn't as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him."\
\
"Thank you, ma'am," said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her\
great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.\
\
Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\
to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a\
minute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,\
and the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out\
of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living\
eyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted\
ones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a\
good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman\
said abruptly, after that dreadful pause, "So you're not afraid of me,\
hey?"\
\
"Not much, sir."\
\
"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?"\
\
"Not quite, sir."\
\
"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?"\
\
"I only said I thought so."\
\
"But you like me, in spite of it?"\
\
"Yes, I do, sir."\
\
That answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook\
hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\
face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying, with a nod, "You've\
got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. He _was_ a fine\
man, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\
I was proud to be his friend."\
\
           [Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]\
\
"Thank you, sir;" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited\
her exactly.\
\
"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?" was the next\
question, sharply put.\
\
"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;" and Jo told how her visit came\
about.\
\
"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"\
\
"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\
perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\
for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us," said Jo\
eagerly.\
\
"Tut, tut, tut! that was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?"\
\
"Doing nicely, sir;" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all\
about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than\
they were.\
\
"Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother\
some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea-bell; we have it early, on\
the boy's account. Come down, and go on being neighborly."\
\
"If you'd like to have me, sir."\
\
"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't;" and Mr. Laurence offered her his arm\
with old-fashioned courtesy.\
\
"What _would_ Meg say to this?" thought Jo, as she was marched away,\
while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story\
at home.\
\
"Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?" said the old\
gentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a\
start of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his\
redoubtable grandfather.\
\
"I didn't know you'd come, sir," he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\
little glance.\
\
"That's evident, by the way you racket down stairs. Come to your tea,\
sir, and behave like a gentleman;" and having pulled the boy's hair by\
way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\
series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\
explosion of laughter from Jo.\
\
The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but\
he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and\
the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light,\
and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine\
merriment in his laugh.\
\
"She's right; the lad _is_ lonely. I'll see what these little girls can\
do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked\
Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the\
boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.\
\
If the Laurences had been what Jo called "prim and poky," she would not\
have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but\
finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\
impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\
something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which\
had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as\
she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either\
side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and\
trees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers\
till his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy\
look Jo liked to see, "Please give these to your mother, and tell her I\
like the medicine she sent me very much."\
\
            [Illustration: Please give these to your mother]\
\
They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great\
drawing-room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,\
which stood open.\
\
"Do you play?" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\
expression.\
\
"Sometimes," he answered modestly.\
\
"Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."\
\
"Won't you first?"\
\
"Don't know how; too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly."\
\
So Laurie played, and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\
heliotrope and tea-roses. Her respect and regard for the "Laurence boy"\
increased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn't put on\
any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so; only\
praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the\
rescue. "That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugar-plums\
are not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well\
in more important things. Going? Well, I'm much obliged to you, and I\
hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good-night, Doctor\
Jo."\
\
He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.\
When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything\
amiss. He shook his head.\
\
"No, it was me; he doesn't like to hear me play."\
\
"Why not?"\
\
"I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't."\
\
"No need of that; I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take care\
of yourself, won't you?"\
\
"Yes; but you will come again, I hope?"\
\
"If you promise to come and see us after you are well."\
\
"I will."\
\
"Good-night, Laurie!"\
\
"Good-night, Jo, good-night!"\
\
When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt\
inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very\
attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March\
wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him;\
Meg longed to walk in the conservatory; Beth sighed for the grand piano;\
and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.\
\
"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?" asked Jo,\
who was of an inquiring disposition.\
\
"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,\
married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\
is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did\
not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died\
when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.\
I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old\
man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes\
naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare\
say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\
rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\
'glowered,' as Jo said."\
\
"Dear me, how romantic!" exclaimed Meg.\
\
"How silly!" said Jo. "Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not\
plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go."\
\
"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\
suppose. Italians are always nice," said Meg, who was a little\
sentimental.\
\
"What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to\
him, hardly," cried Jo, who was _not_ sentimental.\
\
"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\
behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent\
him."\
\
"He meant the blanc-mange, I suppose."\
\
"How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course."\
\
"Did he?" and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\
before.\
\
"I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get it,"\
said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.\
\
"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly,\
and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy, and I like him, and I won't have\
any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We'll all be\
good to him, because he hasn't got any mother, and he _may_ come over\
and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"\
\
"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will\
remember that children should be children as long as they can."\
\
"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet," observed\
Amy. "What do you say, Beth?"\
\
"I was thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progress,'" answered Beth, who had\
not heard a word. "How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket\
Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying; and that\
maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our\
Palace Beautiful."\
\
"We have got to get by the lions, first," said Jo, as if she rather\
liked the prospect.\
\
                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\
\
\
\
\
                                  VI.\
\
                    BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL.\
\
\
The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for\
all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr.\
Laurence was the biggest one; but after he had called, said something\
funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with\
their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The\
other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this\
made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But,\
after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and\
could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\
motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\
that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride, and\
interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.\
\
All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new\
friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and\
he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were regularly\
splendid girls." With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the\
solitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found\
something very charming in the innocent companionship of these\
simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick\
to feel the influences they brought about him; and their busy, lively\
ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of\
books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged\
to make very unsatisfactory reports; for Laurie was always playing\
truant, and running over to the Marches.\
\
"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards," said\
the old gentleman. "The good lady next door says he is studying too\
hard, and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is\
right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his\
grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't\
get into mischief in that little nunnery over there; and Mrs. March is\
doing more for him than we can."\
\
What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such\
sleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\
parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg\
could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\
bouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\
old gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\
beauty to her heart's content; and Laurie played "lord of the manor" in\
the most delightful style.\
\
But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\
courage to go to the "Mansion of Bliss," as Meg called it. She went once\
with Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared\
at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said "Hey!" so loud,\
that he frightened her so much her "feet chattered on the floor," she\
told her mother; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there\
any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements\
could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in\
some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the\
brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and\
talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had\
heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to\
stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if\
fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,\
with her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of\
this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had\
been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers;\
and presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.\
March,--\
\
"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting\
too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of\
your girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to\
keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?"\
\
Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep\
from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the\
thought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath\
away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd\
little nod and smile,--\
\
"They needn't see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I'm\
shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great\
deal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine\
o'clock."\
\
Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\
last arrangement left nothing to be desired. "Please tell the young\
ladies what I say; and if they don't care to come, why, never mind."\
Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\
face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--\
\
"O sir, they do care, very, very much!"\
\
             [Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]\
\
"Are you the musical girl?" he asked, without any startling "Hey!" as he\
looked down at her very kindly.\
\
"I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody\
will hear me--and be disturbed," she added, fearing to be rude, and\
trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.\
\
"Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come, and drum\
away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you."\
\
"How kind you are, sir!"\
\
Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was\
not frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because\
she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.\
The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,\
stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--\
\
"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear!\
Good day, madam;" and away he went, in a great hurry.\
\
Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the\
glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.\
How blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,\
because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\
her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of\
the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\
side-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the\
drawing-room, where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some\
pretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and\
frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\
instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\
else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\
like the voice of a beloved friend.\
\
She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no\
appetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state\
of beatitude.\
\
After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every\
day, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that\
came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his\
study-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie\
mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected\
that the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were\
put there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about\
music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that\
helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what\
isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.\
Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a\
greater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.\
\
        [Illustration: Mr. Laurence often opened his study door]\
\
"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so\
kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do\
it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.\
\
"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking\
him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making\
up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's\
requests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.\
\
After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\
the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet\
cheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very\
appropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with\
occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needle-woman,\
and they were finished before any one got tired of them. Then she wrote\
a very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on\
to the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\
\
When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All\
that day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment\
arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety\
friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\
errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As\
she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads\
popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\
several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--\
\
"Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!"\
\
"O Beth, he's sent you--" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;\
but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.\
\
Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door, her sisters\
seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\
pointing, and all saying at once, "Look there! look there!" Beth did\
look, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a\
little cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,\
like a sign-board, to "Miss Elizabeth March."\
\
"For me?" gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should\
tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.\
\
"Yes; all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you\
think he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the\
letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says," cried\
Jo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.\
\
"You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!" and Beth\
hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\
\
Jo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\
were,--\
\
    "MISS MARCH:\
\
        "_Dear Madam_,--"\
\
"How nice it sounds! I wish some one would write to me so!" said Amy,\
who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.\
\
    "'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had\
    any that suited me so well as yours,'" continued Jo.\
    "'Heart's-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always\
    remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts; so I\
    know you will allow "the old gentleman" to send you something\
    which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With\
    hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain,\
\
    "'Your grateful friend and humble servant,\
\
                                        "'JAMES LAURENCE.'"\
\
"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me\
how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept\
all her little things carefully. Just think, he's given you her piano.\
That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music," said Jo, trying to\
soothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever\
been before.\
\
"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\
puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\
stool, all complete," added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\
its beauties.\
\
"'Your humble servant, James Laurence'; only think of his writing that\
to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid," said Amy,\
much impressed by the note.\
\
"Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby-pianny," said Hannah,\
who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.\
\
So Beth tried it; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano\
ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\
order; but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the\
happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\
touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\
pedals.\
\
"You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke; for the\
idea of the child's really going never entered her head.\
\
"Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking\
about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\
walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\
Laurences' door.\
\
"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The\
pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her right mind,"\
cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\
speechless by the miracle.\
\
They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\
afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the\
study-door before she gave herself time to think; and when a gruff voice\
called out, "Come in!" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who\
looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\
small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank you, sir, for--" But she\
didn't finish; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech,\
and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put\
both arms round his neck, and kissed him.\
\
    [Illustration: She put both arms around his neck and kissed him]\
\
If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\
wouldn't have been more astonished; but he liked it,--oh, dear, yes, he\
liked it amazingly!--and was so touched and pleased by that confiding\
little kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his\
knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he\
had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him\
from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had\
known him all her life; for love casts out fear, and gratitude can\
conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate,\
shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again,\
looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\
gentleman, as he was.\
\
When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of\
expressing her satisfaction; Amy nearly fell out of the window in her\
surprise; and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, "Well, I do believe\
the world is coming to an end!"\
\

\
                      AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.\
\
\
                      [Illustration: The Cyclops]\
\
"That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy, one day, as Laurie\
clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.\
\
"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? and very handsome\
ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about\
her friend.\
\
"I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need fire\
up when I admire his riding."\
\
"Oh, my goodness! that little goose means a centaur, and she called him\
a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.\
\
"You needn't be so rude; it's only a 'lapse of lingy,' as Mr. Davis\
says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. "I just wish I had a\
little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she added, as if to\
herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.\
\
"Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's\
second blunder.\
\
"I need it so much; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to\
have the rag-money for a month."\
\
"In debt, Amy? What do you mean?" and Meg looked sober.\
\
"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you\
know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged\
at the shop."\
\
"Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking\
bits of rubber to make balls;" and Meg tried to keep her countenance,\
Amy looked so grave and important.\
\
"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to\
be thought mean, you must do it, too. It's nothing but limes now, for\
every one is sucking them in their desks in school-time, and trading\
them off for pencils, bead-rings, paper dolls, or something else, at\
recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime; if she's mad\
with her, she eats one before her face, and don't offer even a suck.\
They treat by turns; and I've had ever so many, but haven't returned\
them; and I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know."\
\
"How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?" asked Meg, taking\
out her purse.\
\
"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat\
for you. Don't you like limes?"\
\
"Not much; you may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long\
as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."\
\
"Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket-money! I'll have a\
grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate\
about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering\
for one."\
\
Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the\
temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper\
parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.\
During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four\
delicious limes (she ate one on the way), and was going to treat,\
circulated through her "set," and the attentions of her friends became\
quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the\
spot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and\
Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her\
limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet, and offered to furnish\
answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's\
cutting remarks about "some persons whose noses were not too flat to\
smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud\
to ask for them;" and she instantly crushed "that Snow girl's" hopes by\
the withering telegram, "You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for\
you won't get any."\
\
A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and\
Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe\
rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the\
airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! pride goes before a\
fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.\
No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed\
himself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,\
informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her\
desk.\
\
Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\
vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\
law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\
a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\
newspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\
distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\
one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys\
are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows! but girls are\
infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen, with tyrannical\
tempers, and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis\
knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, Algebra, and ologies of all sorts, so\
he was called a fine teacher; and manners, morals, feelings, and\
examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most\
unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had\
evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning; there was an east\
wind, which always affected his neuralgia; and his pupils had not done\
him the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the\
expressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, "he was as\
nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear." The word "limes" was like\
fire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with\
an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.\
\
"Young ladies, attention, if you please!"\
\
At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,\
gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.\
\
"Miss March, come to the desk."\
\
Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\
her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.\
\
"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk," was the unexpected\
command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.\
\
"Don't take all," whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence\
of mind.\
\
Amy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.\
Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\
that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\
particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\
added to his wrath.\
\
"Is that all?"\
\
"Not quite," stammered Amy.\
\
"Bring the rest immediately."\
\
With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.\
\
"You are sure there are no more?"\
\
"I never lie, sir."\
\
"So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\
out of the window."\
\
There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the\
last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.\
Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;\
and as each doomed couple--looking oh! so plump and juicy--fell from her\
reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the\
girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the\
little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was too\
much; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\
Davis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.\
\
As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous "Hem!"\
and said, in his most impressive manner,--\
\
"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry\
this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\
_never_ break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand."\
\
Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\
look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.\
She was rather a favorite with "old Davis," as, of course, he was\
called, and it's my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word\
if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in\
a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,\
and sealed the culprit's fate.\
\
"Your hand, Miss March!" was the only answer her mute appeal received;\
and, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her\
head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\
little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\
difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck;\
and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\
down.\
\
   [Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]\
\
"You will now stand on the platform till recess," said Mr. Davis,\
resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.\
\
That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and\
see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few\
enemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,\
seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop\
down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of\
wrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking\
the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what\
now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that\
the girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before\
them.\
\
During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little\
girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it\
might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard\
experience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been\
governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\
before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\
in the sting of the thought,--\
\
"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!"\
\
The fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and\
the word "Recess!" had never seemed so welcome to her before.\
\
"You can go, Miss March," said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\
uncomfortable.\
\
He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,\
without a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her\
things, and left the place "forever," as she passionately declared to\
herself. She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older\
girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at\
once. Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted\
her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the\
insulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved\
kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully\
proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her\
fist at the "villain," and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him\
under her pestle.\
\
No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the\
sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in\
the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo\
appeared, wearing a grim expression, as she stalked up to the desk, and\
delivered a letter from her mother; then collected Amy's property, and\
departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as\
if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\
\
"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\
little every day, with Beth," said Mrs. March, that evening. "I don't\
approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.\
Davis's manner of teaching, and don't think the girls you associate with\
are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I\
send you anywhere else."\
\
"That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old\
school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes," sighed\
Amy, with the air of a martyr.\
\
"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\
some punishment for disobedience," was the severe reply, which rather\
disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.\
\
"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?"\
cried Amy.\
\
"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault," replied her\
mother; "but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a milder\
method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite\
time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and\
virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the\
finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness\
will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing\
and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power\
is modesty."\
\
"So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. "I\
knew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she\
didn't know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when\
she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if any one had told her."\
\
"I wish I'd known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I'm so\
stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.\
\
"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,"\
answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\
merry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\
in the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.\
\
                    [Illustration: You do know her]\
\
Jo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\
could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So\
Laurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\
lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\
character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\
said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\
\
"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"\
\
"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\
make a fine man, if not spoilt by petting," replied her mother.\
\
"And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.\
\
"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\
much."\
\
"I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\
show off, or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.\
\
"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and\
conversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display\
them," said Mrs. March.\
\
"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\
ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added Jo; and the\
lecture ended in a laugh.\
\
\
\
\
              [Illustration: Girls, where are you going?]\
\
                                 VIII.\
\
                           JO MEETS APOLLYON.\
\
\
"Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their room one\
Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out, with an\
air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\
\
"Never mind; little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned Jo sharply.\
\
Now if there _is_ anything mortifying to our feelings, when we are\
young, it is to be told that; and to be bidden to "run away, dear," is\
still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined\
to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\
never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, "Do tell me! I\
should think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her\
piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely."\
\
"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg; but Jo broke in\
impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will spoil it all. You can't\
go, Amy; so don't be a baby, and whine about it."\
\
"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were\
whispering and laughing together, on the sofa, last night, and you\
stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?"\
\
"Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering."\
\
Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her\
pocket.\
\
"I know! I know! you're going to the theatre to see the 'Seven\
Castles!'" she cried; adding resolutely, "and I _shall_ go, for mother\
said I might see it; and I've got my rag-money, and it was mean not to\
tell me in time."\
\
"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child," said Meg soothingly.\
"Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well\
enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go\
with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time."\
\
"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let\
me; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for\
some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good," pleaded Amy, looking as\
pathetic as she could.\
\
"Suppose we take her. I don't believe mother would mind, if we bundle\
her up well," began Meg.\
\
"If _she_ goes _I_ sha'n't; and if I don't, Laurie won't like it; and it\
will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I\
should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted," said Jo\
crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,\
when she wanted to enjoy herself.\
\
Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\
in her most aggravating way, "I _shall_ go; Meg says I may; and if I pay\
for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."\
\
"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit\
alone; so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our\
pleasure; or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper, when\
you weren't asked. You sha'n't stir a step; so you may just stay where\
you are," scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger\
in her hurry.\
\
Sitting on the floor, with one boot on, Amy began to cry, and Meg to\
reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\
hurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot\
her grown-up ways, and acted like a spoilt child. Just as the party was\
setting out, Amy called over the banisters, in a threatening tone,\
"You'll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if you ain't."\
\
"Fiddlesticks!" returned Jo, slamming the door.\
\
They had a charming time, for "The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake"\
were as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of\
the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes and\
princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it; the fairy\
queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy; and between the acts she\
amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\
"sorry for it." She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course\
of their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent\
when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\
semi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\
afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\
hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting\
her into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly\
confessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better. Her\
sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,\
because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be\
good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her;\
and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.\
\
When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an\
injured air as they came in; never lifted her eyes from her book, or\
asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\
resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire, and receive a glowing\
description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's\
first look was toward the bureau; for, in their last quarrel, Amy had\
soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the\
floor. Everything was in its place, however; and after a hasty glance\
into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\
forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.\
\
There Jo was mistaken; for next day she made a discovery which produced\
a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the\
afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited, and demanding\
breathlessly, "Has any one taken my book?"\
\
Meg and Beth said "No," at once, and looked surprised; Amy poked the\
fire, and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise, and was down upon her in\
a minute.\
\
"Amy, you've got it?"\
\
"No, I haven't."\
\
"You know where it is, then?"\
\
"No, I don't."\
\
"That's a fib!" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\
fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\
\
"It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't\
care."\
\
"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll\
make you," and Jo gave her a slight shake.\
\
"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book again,"\
cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\
\
"Why not?"\
\
"I burnt it up."\
\
                     [Illustration: I burnt it up]\
\
"What! my little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to\
finish before father got home? Have you really burnt it?" said Jo,\
turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy\
nervously.\
\
"Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,\
and I have, so--"\
\
Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy\
till her teeth chattered in her head; crying, in a passion of grief and\
anger,--\
\
"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never\
forgive you as long as I live."\
\
Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside\
herself; and, with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of\
the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.\
\
The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard\
the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her\
sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her\
family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen\
little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\
whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to\
print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the\
old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of\
several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a\
dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.\
Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her\
pet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would\
love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted\
more than any of them.\
\
When the tea-bell rung, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable\
that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly,--\
\
"Please forgive me, Jo; I'm very, very sorry."\
\
"I never shall forgive you," was Jo's stern answer; and, from that\
moment, she ignored Amy entirely.\
\
No one spoke of the great trouble,--not even Mrs. March,--for all had\
learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted;\
and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own\
generous nature, softened Jo's resentment, and healed the breach. It was\
not a happy evening; for, though they sewed as usual, while their mother\
read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and\
the sweet home-peace was disturbed. They felt this most when\
singing-time came; for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone,\
and Amy broke down, so Meg and mother sung alone. But, in spite of their\
efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flute-like voices did not seem to\
chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.\
\
As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,--\
\
"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other,\
help each other, and begin again to-morrow."\
\
Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief\
and anger all away; but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so\
deeply injured that she really _couldn't_ quite forgive yet. So she\
winked hard, shook her head, and said, gruffly because Amy was\
listening,--\
\
"It was an abominable thing, and she don't deserve to be forgiven."\
\
With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential\
gossip that night.\
\
Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and\
began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than\
ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was\
particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder-cloud, and\
nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning; she\
dropped her precious turn-over in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack\
of fidgets, Meg was pensive, Beth _would_ look grieved and wistful when\
she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always\
talking about being good, and yet wouldn't try, when other people set\
them a virtuous example.\
\
"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always\
kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know," said Jo to herself,\
and off she went.\
\
Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient\
exclamation,--\
\
"There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we\
shall have. But it's no use to ask such a cross-patch to take me."\
\
"Don't say that; you _were_ very naughty, and it _is_ hard to forgive\
the loss of her precious little book; but I think she might do it now,\
and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute," said Meg. "Go\
after them; don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,\
then take a quiet minute, and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and\
I'm sure she'll be friends again, with all her heart."\
\
"I'll try," said Amy, for the advice suited her; and, after a flurry to\
get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over\
the hill.\
\
It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\
them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back; Laurie did not see, for he\
was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm\
spell had preceded the cold snap.\
\
"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right, before we\
begin to race," Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young\
Russian, in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.\
\
Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her\
fingers, as she tried to put her skates on; but Jo never turned, and\
went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\
satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till\
it grew strong, and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\
feelings always do, unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,\
he shouted back,--\
\
"Keep near the shore; it isn't safe in the middle."\
\
Jo heard, but Amy was just struggling to her feet, and did not catch a\
word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was\
harboring said in her ear,--\
\
"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself."\
\
Laurie had vanished round the bend; Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\
far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\
river. For a minute Jo stood still, with a strange feeling at her heart;\
then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round,\
just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with the sudden\
crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart\
stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone;\
she tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in\
them; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring, with\
a terror-stricken face, at the little blue hood above the black water.\
Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out,--\
\
"Bring a rail; quick, quick!"\
\
How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked\
as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\
and, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a\
rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\
frightened than hurt.\
\
           [Illustration: Held Amy up by his arms and hockey]\
\
"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on\
her, while I get off these confounded skates," cried Laurie, wrapping\
his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which never seemed\
so intricate before.\
\
Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home; and, after an\
exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets, before a hot\
fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken; but flown about, looking\
pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands\
cut and bruised by ice and rails, and refractory buckles. When Amy was\
comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed,\
she called Jo to her, and began to bind up the hurt hands.\
\
"Are you sure she is safe?" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the\
golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever\
under the treacherous ice.\
\
"Quite safe, dear; she is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,\
you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly," replied\
her mother cheerfully.\
\
"Laurie did it all; I only let her go. Mother, if she _should_ die, it\
would be my fault"; and Jo dropped down beside the bed, in a passion of\
penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\
hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\
heavy punishment which might have come upon her.\
\
"It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it\
breaks out worse than ever. O mother, what shall I do? what shall I do?"\
cried poor Jo, in despair.\
\
"Watch and pray, dear; never get tired of trying; and never think it is\
impossible to conquer your fault," said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\
head to her shoulder, and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\
cried harder than ever.\
\
"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could\
do anything when I'm in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt any\
one, and enjoy it. I'm afraid I _shall_ do something dreadful some day,\
and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. O mother, help me, do\
help me!"\
\
"I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this day,\
and resolve, with all your soul, that you will never know another like\
it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours,\
and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your\
temper is the worst in the world; but mine used to be just like it."\
\
"Yours, mother? Why, you are never angry!" and, for the moment, Jo\
forgot remorse in surprise.\
\
"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in\
controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have\
learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though\
it may take me another forty years to do so."\
\
The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better\
lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt\
comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her; the\
knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,\
made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it;\
though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray, to a\
girl of fifteen.\
\
"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together, and go\
out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds, or people worry\
you?" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever\
before.\
\
"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips; and\
when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away\
a minute, and give myself a little shake, for being so weak and wicked,"\
answered Mrs. March, with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and\
fastened up Jo's dishevelled hair.\
\
"How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me--for the\
sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about; and the more I say the\
worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings, and say\
dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear."\
\
"My good mother used to help me--"\
\
"As you do us--" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.\
\
"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\
had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\
any one else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\
over my failures; for, in spite of my efforts, I never seemed to get on.\
Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\
good. But by and by, when I had four little daughters round me, and we\
were poor, then the old trouble began again; for I am not patient by\
nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything."\
\
"Poor mother! what helped you then?"\
\
"Your father, Jo. He never loses patience,--never doubts or\
complains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that\
one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me,\
and showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have\
my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try\
for your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of\
you, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have\
done; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the\
sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would\
have them copy."\
\
"O mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied," cried\
Jo, much touched.\
\
"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear; but you must keep watch\
over your 'bosom enemy,' as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\
spoil your life. You have had a warning; remember it, and try with heart\
and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater\
sorrow and regret than you have known to-day."\
\
"I will try, mother; I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and\
keep me from flying out. I used to see father sometimes put his finger\
on his lips, and look at you with a very kind, but sober face, and you\
always folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?"\
asked Jo softly.\
\
"Yes; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\
from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look."\
\
Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled, as she\
spoke; and, fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\
"Was it wrong to watch you, and to speak of it? I didn't mean to be\
rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\
safe and happy here."\
\
"My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest\
happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me, and know how\
much I love them."\
\
"I thought I'd grieved you."\
\
"No, dear; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him, how\
much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\
little daughters safe and good for him."\
\
"Yet you told him to go, mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never\
complain now, or seem as if you needed any help," said Jo, wondering.\
\
"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\
gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and\
will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't seem to need\
help, it is because I have a better friend, even than father, to comfort\
and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are\
beginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if\
you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as\
you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the\
nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power\
and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken\
from you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and\
strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little\
cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as\
you come to your mother."\
\
Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and, in the silence which\
followed, the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\
without words; for in that sad, yet happy hour, she had learned not only\
the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial\
and self-control; and, led by her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to\
the Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of\
any father, tenderer than that of any mother.\
\
Amy stirred, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eager to begin at once\
to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it\
had never worn before.\
\
"I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn't forgive her, and to-day,\
if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I\
be so wicked?" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister,\
softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.\
\
As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a\
smile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word, but they\
hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was\
forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.\
\

\
                        MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR.\
\
\
"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those\
children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one April day, as\
she stood packing the "go abroady" trunk in her room, surrounded by her\
sisters.\
\
"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole\
fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo, looking like a\
windmill, as she folded skirts with her long arms.\
\
"And such lovely weather; I'm so glad of that," added Beth, tidily\
sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great\
occasion.\
\
"I wish I was going to have a fine time, and wear all these nice\
things," said Amy, with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically\
replenished her sister's cushion.\
\
"I wish you were all going; but, as you can't, I shall keep my\
adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can\
do, when you have been so kind, lending me things, and helping me get\
ready," said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\
which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.\
\
"What did mother give you out of the treasure-box?" asked Amy, who had\
not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest, in which Mrs.\
March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\
the proper time came.\
\
"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\
sash. I wanted the violet silk; but there isn't time to make it over, so\
I must be contented with my old tarlatan."\
\
"It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\
off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you\
might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\
possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\
\
"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but\
mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\
and Laurie promised to send me all I want," replied Meg. "Now, let me\
see; there's my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my\
hat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it looks\
heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice; oh,\
dear!"\
\
"Never mind; you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always\
look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding over the little store\
of finery in which her soul delighted.\
\
"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to\
do. My blue house-dress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\
I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion,\
and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's; I didn't like to say\
anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told mother\
black, with a white handle, but she forgot, and bought a green one, with\
a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain,\
but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a\
gold top," sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\
disfavor.\
\
"Change it," advised Jo.\
\
"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much\
pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not\
going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\
are my comfort. You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich,\
and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for\
common;" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.\
\
"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put\
some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\
fresh from Hannah's hands.\
\
"No, I wouldn't; for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns, without\
any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig," said Jo decidedly.\
\
"I wonder if I shall _ever_ be happy enough to have real lace on my\
clothes, and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.\
\
"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only\
go to Annie Moffat's," observed Beth, in her quiet way.\
\
"So I did! Well, I _am_ happy, and I _won't_ fret; but it does seem as\
if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There, now, the\
trays are ready, and everything in but my ball-dress, which I shall\
leave for mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from\
the half-filled trunk to the many-times pressed and mended white\
tarlatan, which she called her "ball-dress," with an important air.\
\
The next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of\
novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\
reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\
than she went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to\
take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after\
a winter of irksome work, that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\
to take her first taste of fashionable life.\
\
The Moffats _were_ very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\
at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\
occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\
they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\
without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or\
intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal\
the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was\
agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best\
frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her\
exactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\
those about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\
crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well\
as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more\
she envied her, and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal\
as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she\
was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves\
and silk stockings.\
\
She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\
were busily employed in "having a good time." They shopped, walked,\
rode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at\
home in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to\
entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\
was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\
Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.\
Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her\
daughter had done. Every one petted her; and "Daisy," as they called\
her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.\
\
When the evening for the "small party" came, she found that the poplin\
wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,\
and making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,\
looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new\
one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\
cheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.\
No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\
Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\
arms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\
heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,\
chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter\
feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of\
flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were\
exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\
\
"It's for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are\
altogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a great sniff.\
\
"They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note," put in the\
maid, holding it to Meg.\
\
"What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover," cried the\
girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\
\
"The note is from mother, and the flowers from Laurie," said Meg simply,\
yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\
\
"Oh, indeed!" said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\
into her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\
pride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\
cheered her up by their beauty.\
\
Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\
herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\
breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\
Clara, the elder sister, told her she was "the sweetest little thing she\
ever saw;" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\
Somehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest\
went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\
face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and\
fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so _very_\
shabby now.\
\
She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\
heart's content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.\
Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice;\
Major Lincoln asked who "the fresh little girl, with the beautiful\
eyes," was; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her, because she\
"didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her," as he gracefully expressed\
it. So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit\
of a conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just\
inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,\
when she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--\
\
"How old is he?"\
\
"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.\
\
"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie\
says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them."\
\
"Mrs M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\
early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet," said Mrs.\
Moffat.\
\
"She told that fib about her mamma, as if she did know, and colored up\
when the flowers came, quite prettily. Poor thing! she'd be so nice if\
she was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be offended if we\
offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?" asked another voice.\
\
"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is\
all she has got. She may tear it to-night, and that will be a good\
excuse for offering a decent one."\
\
"We'll see. I shall ask young Laurence, as a compliment to her, and\
we'll have fun about it afterward."\
\
                 [Illustration: Meg's partner appeared]\
\
Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather\
agitated. She _was_ proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it\
helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had\
just heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not\
help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it,\
but could not, and kept repeating to herself, "Mrs. M. has made her\
plans," "that fib about her mamma," and "dowdy tarlatan," till she was\
ready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As\
that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather\
excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she\
was making. She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in\
her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached\
and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish,\
yet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed\
the peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily\
as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly\
speeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken\
by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others\
by herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple\
wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter, was weakened by the\
unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest\
calamities under heaven.\
\
Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\
resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\
speaking out frankly, and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled\
that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\
to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends\
struck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;\
took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\
eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered\
her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her\
writing, and said, with a sentimental air,--\
\
"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\
Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a proper compliment\
to you."\
\
Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\
demurely,--\
\
"You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come."\
\
"Why not, _ch\'e9rie_?" asked Miss Belle.\
\
"He's too old."\
\
"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!" cried Miss\
Clara.\
\
"Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches, to hide\
the merriment in her eyes.\
\
"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man," exclaimed Miss\
Belle, laughing.\
\
"There isn't any; Laurie is only a little boy," and Meg laughed also at\
the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\
supposed lover.\
\
"About your age," Nan said.\
\
"Nearer my sister Jo's; _I_ am seventeen in August," returned Meg,\
tossing her head.\
\
"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said Annie,\
looking wise about nothing.\
\
"Yes, he often does, to all of us; for their house is full, and we are\
so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\
so it is quite natural that we children should play together;" and Meg\
hoped they would say no more.\
\
"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet," said Miss Clara to Belle, with a\
nod.\
\
"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round," returned Miss Belle,\
with a shrug.\
\
"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls; can I do\
anything for you, young ladies?" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in, like\
an elephant, in silk and lace.\
\
"No, thank you, ma'am," replied Sallie. "I've got my new pink silk for\
Thursday, and don't want a thing."\
\
"Nor I,--" began Meg, but stopped, because it occurred to her that she\
_did_ want several things, and could not have them.\
\
"What shall you wear?" asked Sallie.\
\
"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly\
torn last night," said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\
very uncomfortable.\
\
"Why don't you send home for another?" said Sallie, who was not an\
observing young lady.\
\
"I haven't got any other." It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie\
did not see it, and exclaimed, in amiable surprise,--\
\
"Only that? How funny--" She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook\
her head at her, and broke in, saying kindly,--\
\
"Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't\
out? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen,\
for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you\
shall wear it, to please me, won't you, dear?"\
\
"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress, if you don't; it does\
well enough for a little girl like me," said Meg.\
\
"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do\
it, and you'd be a regular little beauty, with a touch here and there. I\
sha'n't let any one see you till you are done, and then we'll burst upon\
them like Cinderella and her godmother, going to the ball," said Belle,\
in her persuasive tone.\
\
Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she\
would be "a little beauty" after touching up, caused her to accept, and\
forget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats.\
\
On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid; and,\
between them, they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled\
her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\
touched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense\
would have added "a _soup\'e7on_ of rouge," if Meg had not rebelled. They\
laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\
breathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\
the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\
brooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of\
pink silk, which did not show. A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,\
and a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white\
shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last\
wish of her heart. A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a\
silver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\
satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\
\
"Mademoiselle is charmante, tr\'e8s jolie, is she not?" cried Hortense,\
clasping her hands in an affected rapture.\
\
"Come and show yourself," said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\
where the others were waiting.\
\
As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings\
tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\
"fun" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\
she _was_ "a little beauty." Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\
enthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw\
in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered\
like a party of magpies.\
\
"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt,\
and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver\
butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\
Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands," said\
Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\
\
"I'm afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,"\
said Meg to Sallie, as the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the\
young ladies to appear at once.\
\
"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere\
beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I\
assure you. Let your flowers hang; don't be so careful of them, and be\
sure you don't trip," returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\
prettier than herself.\
\
                 [Illustration: Asked to be introduced]\
\
Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs,\
and sailed into the drawing-rooms, where the Moffats and a few early\
guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm\
about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people, and secures\
their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\
before, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen,\
who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but\
asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable\
things to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticised\
the rest of the party, inquired who she was, with an air of interest.\
She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them,--\
\
"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,\
but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;\
sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her."\
\
"Dear me!" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another\
observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard, and been\
rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.\
\
The "queer feeling" did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting\
the new part of fine lady, and so got on pretty well, though the tight\
dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and\
she was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off, and get lost\
or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of\
a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped\
laughing and looked confused; for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was\
staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she\
thought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest\
eyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her\
confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to\
Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.\
\
"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head! I won't care for\
it, or let it change me a bit," thought Meg, and rustled across the room\
to shake hands with her friend.\
\
"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't," she said, with her most\
grown-up air.\
\
"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did;" answered\
Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her\
maternal tone.\
\
"What shall you tell her?" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his\
opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him, for the first time.\
\
"I shall say I didn't know you; for you look so grown-up, and unlike\
yourself, I'm quite afraid of you," he said, fumbling at his\
glove-button.\
\
"How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like\
it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?" said Meg, bent on making him say\
whether he thought her improved or not.\
\
"Yes, I think she would," returned Laurie gravely.\
\
"Don't you like me so?" asked Meg.\
\
"No, I don't," was the blunt reply.\
\
"Why not?" in an anxious tone.\
\
He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically\
trimmed dress, with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,\
which had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.\
\
"I don't like fuss and feathers."\
\
That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself; and Meg\
walked away, saying petulantly,--\
\
"You are the rudest boy I ever saw."\
\
Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window, to cool\
her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant\
color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,\
she heard him saying to his mother,--\
\
"They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,\
but they have spoilt her entirely; she's nothing but a doll, to-night."\
\
"Oh, dear!" sighed Meg; "I wish I'd been sensible, and worn my own\
things; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so\
uncomfortable and ashamed myself."\
\
She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\
curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one\
touched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,\
with his very best bow, and his hand out,--\
\
"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."\
\
"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you," said Meg, trying to\
look offended, and failing entirely.\
\
"Not a bit of it; I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good; I don't like\
your gown, but I do think you are--just splendid;" and he waved his\
hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.\
\
Meg smiled and relented, and whispered, as they stood waiting to catch\
the time,--\
\
"Take care my skirt don't trip you up; it's the plague of my life, and I\
was a goose to wear it."\
\
"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful," said Laurie,\
looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.\
\
Away they went, fleetly and gracefully; for, having practised at home,\
they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant\
sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more\
friendly than ever after their small tiff.\
\
"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor; will you?" said Meg, as he stood\
fanning her, when her breath gave out, which it did very soon, though\
she would not own why.\
\
"Won't I!" said Laurie, with alacrity.\
\
"Please don't tell them at home about my dress to-night. They won't\
understand the joke, and it will worry mother."\
\
"Then why did you do it?" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg\
hastily added,--\
\
"I shall tell them, myself, all about it, and ''fess' to mother how\
silly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself; so you'll not tell, will\
you?"\
\
"I give you my word I won't; only what shall I say when they ask me?"\
\
"Just say I looked pretty well, and was having a good time."\
\
"I'll say the first, with all my heart; but how about the other? You\
don't look as if you were having a good time; are you?" and Laurie\
looked at her with an expression which made her answer, in a whisper,--\
\
"No; not just now. Don't think I'm horrid; I only wanted a little fun,\
but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it."\
\
"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?" said Laurie, knitting his\
black brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\
pleasant addition to the party.\
\
"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for\
them. What a bore!" said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused\
Laurie immensely.\
\
He did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking\
champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving "like a pair\
of fools," as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of\
right to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a\
defender was needed.\
\
                    [Illustration: I wouldn't, Meg]\
\
"You'll have a splitting headache to-morrow, if you drink much of that.\
I wouldn't Meg; your mother doesn't like it, you know," he whispered,\
leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass, and Fisher\
stooped to pick up her fan.\
\
"I'm not Meg, to-night; I'm 'a doll,' who does all sorts of crazy\
things. To-morrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers,' and be\
desperately good again," she answered, with an affected little laugh.\
\
"Wish to-morrow was here, then," muttered Laurie, walking off,\
ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.\
\
Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did;\
after supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly\
upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that\
scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no\
chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\
good-night.\
\
"Remember!" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\
already begun.\
\
"Silence \'e0 la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he\
went away.\
\
This little bit of by-play excited Annie's curiosity; but Meg was too\
tired for gossip, and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a\
masquerade, and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was\
sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her\
fortnight's fun, and feeling that she had "sat in the lap of luxury"\
long enough.\
\
"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all\
the time. Home _is_ a nice place, though it isn't splendid," said Meg,\
looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother\
and Jo on the Sunday evening.\
\
"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem\
dull and poor to you, after your fine quarters," replied her mother, who\
had given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly eyes are quick\
to see any change in children's faces.\
\
Meg had told her adventures gayly, and said over and over what a\
charming time she had had; but something still seemed to weigh upon her\
spirits, and, when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat\
thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little, and looking worried. As\
the clock struck nine, and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair,\
and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying\
bravely,--\
\
"Marmee, I want to ''fess.'"\
\
"I thought so; what is it, dear?"\
\
"Shall I go away?" asked Jo discreetly.\
\
"Of course not; don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to\
speak of it before the children, but I want you to know all the dreadful\
things I did at the Moffat's."\
\
"We are prepared," said Mrs. March, smiling, but looking a little\
anxious.\
\
"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered\
and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie\
thought I wasn't proper; I know he did, though he didn't say so, and one\
man called me 'a doll.' I knew it was silly, but they flattered me, and\
said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a\
fool of me."\
\
"Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast\
face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame\
her little follies.\
\
"No; I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether\
abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.\
\
"There is something more, I think;" and Mrs. March smoothed the soft\
cheek, which suddenly grew rosy, as Meg answered slowly,--\
\
"Yes; it's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have\
people say and think such things about us and Laurie."\
\
Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats;\
and, as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill\
pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.\
\
"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried Jo\
indignantly. "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so, on the spot?"\
\
"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help hearing, at\
first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I\
ought to go away."\
\
"Just wait till _I_ see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle\
such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having 'plans,' and being kind to\
Laurie, because he's rich, and may marry us by and by! Won't he shout,\
when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?" and\
Jo laughed, as if, on second thoughts, the thing struck her as a good\
joke.\
\
"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must she,\
mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.\
\
"No; never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you\
can," said Mrs. March gravely. "I was very unwise to let you go among\
people of whom I know so little,--kind, I dare say, but worldly,\
ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more\
sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,\
Meg."\
\
"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me; I'll forget all the bad, and\
remember only the good; for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very\
much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, mother;\
I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till I'm fit to\
take care of myself. But it _is_ nice to be praised and admired, and I\
can't help saying I like it," said Meg, looking half ashamed of the\
confession.\
\
"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not\
become a passion, and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn\
to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the\
admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg."\
\
Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind\
her, looking both interested and a little perplexed; for it was a new\
thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and\
things of that sort; and Jo felt as if, during that fortnight, her\
sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a\
world where she could not follow.\
\
"Mother, do you have 'plans,' as Mrs. Moffat said?" asked Meg bashfully.\
\
"Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ\
somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some of them,\
for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and\
heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but\
not too young to understand me; and mothers' lips are the fittest to\
speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time,\
perhaps, so listen to my 'plans,' and help me carry them out, if they\
are good."\
\
Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they\
were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,\
and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her\
serious yet cheery way,--\
\
      [Illustration: Holding a hand of each, Mrs. March said, &c.]\
\
"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be\
admired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and\
wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care\
and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen\
by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a\
woman; and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.\
It is natural to think of it, Meg; right to hope and wait for it, and\
wise to prepare for it; so that, when the happy time comes, you may\
feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I _am_\
ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world,--marry\
rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which\
are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious\
thing,--and, when well used, a noble thing,--but I never want you to\
think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you\
poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on\
thrones, without self-respect and peace."\
\
"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put\
themselves forward," sighed Meg.\
\
"Then we'll be old maids," said Jo stoutly.\
\
"Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly\
girls, running about to find husbands," said Mrs. March decidedly.\
"Don't be troubled, Meg; poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of\
the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so\
love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these\
things to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes\
of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are\
not. One thing remember, my girls: mother is always ready to be your\
confidant, father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope that\
our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort\
of our lives."\
\
"We will, Marmee, we will!" cried both, with all their hearts, as she\
bade them good-night.\
\
\
\
\
                                   X.\
\
                          THE P. C. AND P. O.\
\
\
As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the\
lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.\
The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the\
little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, "I'd know\
which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny;" and so\
she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.\
Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange-tree in it.\
Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying\
experiments; this year it was to be a plantation of sun-flowers, the\
seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed "Aunt\
Cockle-top" and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant\
flowers in her garden,--sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,\
pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird, and catnip for\
the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers,--rather small and earwiggy, but\
very pretty to look at,--with honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging\
their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it; tall,\
white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants\
as would consent to blossom there.\
\
Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower-hunts employed the fine\
days; and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,--some old, some\
new,--all more or less original. One of these was the "P. C."; for, as\
secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one;\
and, as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the\
Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a\
year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which\
occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in\
a row before a table, on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with\
a big "P. C." in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper,\
called "The Pickwick Portfolio," to which all contributed something;\
while Jo, who revelled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven\
o'clock, the four members ascended to the club-room, tied their badges\
round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as\
the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus\
Snodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,\
who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.\
Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original\
tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which\
they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and\
short-comings.\

\
On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any\
glasses, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr.\
Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself\
properly, began to read:--\

        Again we meet to celebrate\
          With badge and solemn rite,\
        Our fifty-second anniversary,\
          In Pickwick Hall, to-night.\
\
        We all are here in perfect health,\
          None gone from our small band;\
        Again we see each well-known face,\
          And press each friendly hand.\
\
        Our Pickwick, always at his post,\
          With reverence we greet,\
        As, spectacles on nose, he reads\
          Our well-filled weekly sheet.\
\
        Although he suffers from a cold,\
          We joy to hear him speak,\
        For words of wisdom from him fall,\
          In spite of croak or squeak.\
\
        Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,\
          With elephantine grace,\
        And beams upon the company,\
          With brown and jovial face.\
\
        Poetic fire lights up his eye,\
          He struggles 'gainst his lot.\
        Behold ambition on his brow,\
          And on his nose a blot!\
\
        Next our peaceful Tupman comes,\
          So rosy, plump, and sweet.\
        Who chokes with laughter at the puns,\
          And tumbles off his seat.\
\
        Prim little Winkle too is here,\
          With every hair in place,\
        A model of propriety,\
          Though he hates to wash his face.\
\
        The year is gone, we still unite\
          To joke and laugh and read,\
        And tread the path of literature\
          That doth to glory lead.\
\
        Long may our paper prosper well,\
          Our club unbroken be,\
        And coming years their blessings pour\
          On the useful, gay "P. C."\

                          THE MASKED MARRIAGE.\
\
                           A TALE OF VENICE.\
\
    Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its\
    lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the\
    stately halls of Count de Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and\
    pages, monks and flower-girls, all mingled gayly in the dance.\
    Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air; and so with mirth\
    and music the masquerade went on.\
\
    "Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola to-night?" asked a\
    gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall\
    upon his arm.\
\
    "Yes; is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well\
    chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she\
    passionately hates."\
\
    "By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a\
    bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see\
    how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though\
    her stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.\
\
    "'Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who\
    haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old count," said the\
    lady, as they joined the dance.\
\
    The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and,\
    withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet,\
    he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell upon the gay\
    throng; and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle\
    of orange-groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as\
    Count de Adelon spoke thus:--\
\
    "My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered\
    you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait\
    your services."\
\
    All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a low murmur of\
    amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom\
    removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts,\
    but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over.\
    Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an\
    explanation.\
\
    "Gladly would I give it if I could; but I only know that it was\
    the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my\
    children, let the play end. Unmask, and receive my blessing."\
\
    But neither bent the knee; for the young bridegroom replied, in\
    a tone that startled all listeners, as the mask fell, disclosing\
    the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover; and,\
    leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English\
    earl, was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.\
\
    "My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I\
    could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count\
    Antonio. I can do more; for even your ambitious soul cannot\
    refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his\
    ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand\
    of this fair lady, now my wife."\
\
    The count stood like one changed to stone; and, turning to the\
    bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph,\
    "To you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing\
    may prosper as mine has done; and that you may all win as fair a\
    bride as I have, by this masked marriage."\

\
    Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden,\
    and after a while it sprouted and became a vine, and bore many\
    squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one\
    and took it to market. A grocer-man bought and put it in his\
    shop. That same morning, a little girl, in a brown hat and blue\
    dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for\
    her mother. She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the\
    big pot; mashed some of it, with salt and butter, for dinner;\
    and to the rest she added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons\
    of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers; put it in a deep dish, and\
    baked it till it was brown and nice; and next day it was eaten\
    by a family named March.\

    MR. PICKWICK, _Sir_:--\
\
    I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man\
    named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and\
    sometimes won't write his piece in this fine paper I hope you\
    will pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because\
    he can't write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do\
    and no brains in future I will try to take time by the fetlock\
    and prepare some work which will be all _commy la fo_ that means\
    all right I am in haste as it is nearly school time\

                              A SAD ACCIDENT.\
\
    On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our\
    basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing, in a body,\
    to the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate\
    upon the floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for\
    domestic purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes; for in\
    his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a\
    tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and\
    torn his garments badly. On being removed from this perilous\
    situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but\
    several bruises; and, we are happy to add, is now doing well.\
                                                                 ED.\

\
                           FOR S. B. PAT PAW.\
\
        We mourn the loss of our little pet,\
          And sigh o'er her hapless fate,\
        For never more by the fire she'll sit,\
          Nor play by the old green gate.\
\
        The little grave where her infant sleeps,\
          Is 'neath the chestnut tree;\
        But o'er _her_ grave we may not weep,\
          We know not where it may be.\
\
        Her empty bed, her idle ball,\
          Will never see her more;\
        No gentle tap, no loving purr\
          Is heard at the parlor-door.\

        Another cat comes after her mice,\
          A cat with a dirty face;\
        But she does not hunt as our darling did,\
          Nor play with her airy grace.\
\
        Her stealthy paws tread the very hall\
          Where Snowball used to play,\
        But she only spits at the dogs our pet\
          So gallantly drove away.\
\
        She is useful and mild, and does her best,\
          But she is not fair to see;\
        And we cannot give her your place, dear,\
          Nor worship her as we worship thee.\

        Amy--Middling.\
\
\
As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to assure\
my readers is a _bona fide_ copy of one written by _bona fide_ girls\
once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass\
rose to make a proposition.\
\
"Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a parliamentary\
attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission of a new\
member,--one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for\
it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary\
value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr. Theodore\
Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have him."\
\
Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh; but all looked rather\
anxious, and no one said a word, as Snodgrass took his seat.\
\
"We'll put it to vote," said the President. "All in favor of this motion\
please to manifest it by saying 'Ay.'"\
\
A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a\
timid one from Beth.\
\
"Contrary minded say 'No.'"\
\
Meg and Amy were contrary minded; and Mr. Winkle rose to say, with great\
elegance, "We don't wish any boys; they only joke and bounce about. This\
is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper."\
\
"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,"\
observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she\
always did when doubtful.\
\
Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. "Sir, I give you my word as a\
gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes to write, and\
he'll give a tone to our contributions, and keep us from being\
sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so\
much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here,\
and make him welcome if he comes."\
\
This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet,\
looking as if he had quite made up his mind.\
\
"Yes, we ought to do it, even if we _are_ afraid. I say he _may_ come,\
and his grandpa, too, if he likes."\
\
This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her\
seat to shake hands approvingly. "Now then, vote again. Everybody\
remember it's our Laurie, and say 'Ay!'" cried Snodgrass excitedly.\
\
"Ay! ay! ay!" replied three voices at once.\
\
"Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like 'taking time by the\
_fetlock_,' as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present\
the new member;" and, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw\
open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag-bag,\
flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.\
\
          [Illustration: Jo threw open the door of the closet]\
\
"You rogue! you traitor! Jo, how could you?" cried the three girls, as\
Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth; and, producing both a chair\
and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.\
\
"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing," began Mr. Pickwick, trying\
to get up an awful frown, and only succeeding in producing an amiable\
smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion; and, rising, with a\
grateful salutation to the Chair, said, in the most engaging manner,\
"Mr. President and ladies,--I beg pardon, gentlemen,--allow me to\
introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club."\
\
"Good! good!" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming-pan\
on which she leaned.\
\
"My faithful friend and noble patron," continued Laurie, with a wave of\
the hand, "who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for\
the base stratagem of to-night. I planned it, and she only gave in after\
lots of teasing."\
\
"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself; you know I proposed the\
cupboard," broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.\
\
"Never you mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir," said\
the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. "But on my\
honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth _dewote_ myself to the\
interest of this immortal club."\
\
"Hear! hear!" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming-pan like a\
cymbal.\
\
"Go on, go on!" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed\
benignly.\
\
"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the\
honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between\
adjoining nations, I have set up a post-office in the hedge in the lower\
corner of the garden; a fine, spacious building, with padlocks on the\
doors, and every convenience for the mails,--also the females, if I may\
be allowed the expression. It's the old martin-house; but I've stopped\
up the door, and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of\
things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and\
bundles can be passed in there; and, as each nation has a key, it will\
be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key; and,\
with many thanks for your favor, take my seat."\
\
Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table, and\
subsided; the warming-pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time\
before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and every\
one came out surprising, for every one did her best; so it was an\
unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it\
broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.\
\
No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,\
well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add\
"spirit" to the meetings, and "a tone" to the paper; for his orations\
convulsed his hearers, and his contributions were excellent, being\
patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo\
regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare; and remodelled\
her own works with good effect, she thought.\
\
The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully,\
for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real\
office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden-seeds and long\
letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings and\
puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending\
odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams; and his gardener,\
who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love-letter to\
Jo's care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how\
many love-letters that little post-office would hold in the years to\
come!\

\
\
"The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore to-morrow, and I'm\
free. Three months' vacation,--how I shall enjoy it!" exclaimed Meg,\
coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual\
state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made\
lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.\
\
"Aunt March went to-day, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo. "I was\
mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have\
felt as if I ought to do it; but Plumfield is about as gay as a\
churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry getting\
the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I\
was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and\
sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked\
till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for, as it\
drove off, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josy-phine, won't you--?'\
I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled; I did actually\
run, and whisked round the corner, where I felt safe."\
\
"Poor old Jo! she came in looking as if bears were after her," said\
Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.\
\
"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy, tasting\
her mixture critically.\
\
"She means _vampire_, not sea-weed; but it doesn't matter; it's too warm\
to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured Jo.\
\
"What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing the subject,\
with tact.\
\
"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from the depths of\
the rocking-chair. "I've been routed up early all winter, and had to\
spend my days working for other people; so now I'm going to rest and\
revel to my heart's content."\
\
"No," said Jo; "that dozy way wouldn't suit me. I've laid in a heap of\
books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in\
the old apple-tree, when I'm not having l------"\
\
"Don't say 'larks!'" implored Amy, as a return snub for the "samphire"\
correction.\
\
"I'll say 'nightingales,' then, with Laurie; that's proper and\
appropriate, since he's a warbler."\
\
"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time,\
and rest, as the girls mean to," proposed Amy.\
\
"Well, I will, if mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some new songs,\
and my children need fitting up for the summer; they are dreadfully out\
of order, and really suffering for clothes."\
\
"May we, mother?" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing, in\
what they called "Marmee's corner."\
\
"You may try your experiment for a week, and see how you like it. I\
think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as\
bad as all work and no play."\
\
"Oh, dear, no! it will be delicious, I'm sure," said Meg complacently.\
\
"I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp,' says.\
Fun forever, and no grubbing!" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the\
lemonade went round.\
\
They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the\
rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock; her\
solitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room seemed lonely and\
untidy; for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's\
books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but "Marmee's\
corner," which looked as usual; and there Meg sat, to "rest and read,"\
which meant yawn, and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get\
with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river, with Laurie, and the\
afternoon reading and crying over "The Wide, Wide World," up in the\
apple-tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet,\
where her family resided; but, getting tired before half done, she left\
her establishment topsy-turvy, and went to her music, rejoicing that she\
had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white\
frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw, under the honeysuckles,\
hoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no\
one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-long-legs, who examined her work\
with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home\
dripping.\
\
                  [Illustration: Amy sat down to draw]\
\
At tea-time they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a\
delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the\
afternoon, and got a "sweet blue muslin," had discovered, after she had\
cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her\
slightly cross. Jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating, and got a\
raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion\
of her closet, and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at\
once; and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy\
Brown's party was to be the next day; and now, like Flora McFlimsey, she\
had "nothing to wear." But these were mere trifles; and they assured\
their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said\
nothing, and, with Hannah's help, did their neglected work, keeping home\
pleasant, and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was\
astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was\
produced by the "resting and revelling" process. The days kept getting\
longer and longer; the weather was unusually variable, and so were\
tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed every one, and Satan found\
plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury,\
Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that\
she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes, in her attempts to\
furbish them up \'e0 la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out, and she was\
sick of books; got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a\
quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished\
she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was\
constantly forgetting that it was to be _all play, and no work_, and\
fell back into her old ways now and then; but something in the air\
affected her, and, more than once, her tranquillity was much disturbed;\
so much so, that, on one occasion, she actually shook poor dear Joanna,\
and told her she was "a fright." Amy fared worst of all, for her\
resources were small; and when her sisters left her to amuse and care\
for herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self\
a great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy-tales were childish, and\
one couldn't draw all the time; tea-parties didn't amount to much,\
neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. "If one could have a\
fine house, full of nice girls, or go travelling, the summer would be\
delightful; but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a\
grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz," complained Miss\
Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and _ennui_.\
\
No one would own that they were tired of the experiment; but, by Friday\
night, each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was\
nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who\
had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an\
appropriate manner; so she gave Hannah a holiday, and let the girls\
enjoy the full effect of the play system.\
\
When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,\
no breakfast in the dining-room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.\
\
"Mercy on us! what _has_ happened?" cried Jo, staring about her in\
dismay.\
\
Meg ran upstairs, and soon came back again, looking relieved, but rather\
bewildered, and a little ashamed.\
\
"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay\
quietly in her room all day, and let us do the best we can. It's a very\
queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself; but she\
says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble, but take\
care of ourselves."\
\
"That's easy enough, and I like the idea; I'm aching for something to\
do--that is, some new amusement, you know," added Jo quickly.\
\
In fact it _was_ an immense relief to them all to have a little work,\
and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's\
saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke." There was plenty of food in the\
larder, and, while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,\
wondering, as they did so, why servants ever talked about hard work.\
\
"I shall take some up to mother, though she said we were not to think of\
her, for she'd take care of herself," said Meg, who presided, and felt\
quite matronly behind the teapot.\
\
So a tray was fitted out before any one began, and taken up, with the\
cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelette\
scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus; but Mrs. March\
received her repast with thanks, and laughed heartily over it after Jo\
was gone.\
\
"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid; but they\
won't suffer, and it will do them good," she said, producing the more\
palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of\
the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt,--a motherly\
little deception, for which they were grateful.\
\
Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook\
at her failures. "Never mind, I'll get the dinner, and be servant; you\
be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders," said\
Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.\
\
This obliging offer was gladly accepted; and Margaret retired to the\
parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the\
sofa, and shutting the blinds, to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with\
perfect faith in her own powers, and a friendly desire to make up the\
quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to\
dinner.\
\
"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having company,"\
said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.\
\
"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes; and I shall get some\
asparagus, and a lobster, 'for a relish,' as Hannah says. We'll have\
lettuce, and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll\
have blanc-mange and strawberries for dessert; and coffee, too, if you\
want to be elegant."\
\
"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but\
gingerbread and molasses candy, fit to eat. I wash my hands of the\
dinner-party; and, since you have asked Laurie on your own\
responsibility, you may just take care of him."\
\
"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him, and help to the\
pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?"\
asked Jo, rather hurt.\
\
"Yes; but I don't know much, except about bread, and a few trifles. You\
had better ask mother's leave before you order anything," returned Meg\
prudently.\
\
"Of course I shall; I'm not a fool," and Jo went off in a huff at the\
doubts expressed of her powers.\
\
"Get what you like, and don't disturb me; I'm going out to dinner, and\
can't worry about things at home," said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to\
her. "I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation\
to-day, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself."\
\
The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably, and\
reading, early in the morning, made Jo feel as if some natural\
phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic\
eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.\
\
"Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself, going down\
stairs. "There's Beth crying; that's a sure sign that something is wrong\
with this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her."\
\
Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to\
find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage, with\
his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for\
want of which he had died.\
\
"It's all my fault--I forgot him--there isn't a seed or a drop left. O\
Pip! O Pip! how could I be so cruel to you?" cried Beth, taking the poor\
thing in her hands, and trying to restore him.\
\
                     [Illustration: O Pip! O Pip!]\
\
Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him\
stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino-box for a coffin.\
\
"Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive," said Amy\
hopefully.\
\
"He's been starved, and he sha'n't be baked, now he's dead. I'll make\
him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden; and I'll never have\
another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one," murmured\
Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.\
\
"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don't\
cry, Bethy; it's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has\
had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box;\
and, after the dinner-party, we'll have a nice little funeral," said Jo,\
beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.\
\
Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which\
was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron,\
she fell to work, and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when\
she discovered that the fire was out.\
\
"Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove-door open,\
and poking vigorously among the cinders.\
\
Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the\
water heated. The walk revived her spirits; and, flattering herself that\
she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very\
young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid\
strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived, and\
the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had\
worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and\
forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when\
the door flew open, and a floury, crocky, flushed, and dishevelled\
figure appeared, demanding tartly,--\
\
"I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?"\
\
Sallie began to laugh; but Meg nodded, and lifted her eyebrows as high\
as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish, and put the\
sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out,\
after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word\
of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding-sheet, while the dear\
departed lay in state in the domino-box. A strange sense of helplessness\
fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner; and\
despair seized them, when, a few minutes later, Miss Crocker appeared,\
and said she'd come to dinner. Now, this lady was a thin, yellow\
spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything,\
and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught\
to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor, and had few\
friends. So Meg gave her the easy-chair, and tried to entertain her,\
while she asked questions, criticised everything, and told stories of\
the people whom she knew.\
\
Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which\
Jo underwent that morning; and the dinner she served up became a\
standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\
and discovered that something more than energy and good-will is\
necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour, and was\
grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\
The bread burnt black; for the salad-dressing so aggravated her, that\
she let everything else go till she had convinced herself that she could\
not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but\
she hammered and poked, till it was unshelled, and its meagre\
proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce-leaves. The potatoes had to\
be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\
last. The blanc-mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as\
they looked, having been skilfully "deaconed."\
\
"Well, they can eat beef, and bread and butter, if they are hungry; only\
it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,"\
thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\
stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread for\
Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose\
curious eyes would mark all failures, and whose tattling tongue would\
report them far and wide.\
\
Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\
another was tasted and left; while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\
Miss Crocker pursed up her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\
his might, to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong\
point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of\
rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew\
a long breath, as the pretty glass plates went round, and every one\
looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream.\
Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water\
hastily. Jo, who had refused, thinking there might not be enough, for\
they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he\
was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\
mouth, and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of\
delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\
napkin, and left the table precipitately.\
\
              [Illustration: Miss Crocker made a wry face]\
\
"Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo trembling.\
\
"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg, with a\
tragic gesture.\
\
Jo uttered a groan, and fell back in her chair; remembering that she had\
given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\
on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\
refrigerator. She turned scarlet, and was on the verge of crying, when\
she met Laurie's eyes, which _would_ look merry in spite of his heroic\
efforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\
laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did every one else, even\
"Croaker," as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner\
ended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\
\
"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\
ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose; and Miss Crocker made\
ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's\
dinner-table.\
\
They did sober themselves, for Beth's sake; Laurie dug a grave under the\
ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears, by his\
tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\
violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\
composed by Jo, while she struggled with the dinner:--\
\
        "Here lies Pip March,\
           Who died the 7th of June;\
         Loved and lamented sore,\
           And not forgotten soon."\
\
At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\
with emotion and lobster; but there was no place of repose, for the beds\
were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\
pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the\
remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon, and left them so\
tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\
Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\
cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came\
home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\
afternoon; and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of\
one part of the experiment.\
\
Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a\
scramble to get ready to see them; then tea must be got, errands done;\
and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute.\
As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered in the porch\
where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or\
sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\
\
"What a dreadful day this has been!" begun Jo, usually the first to\
speak.\
\
"It has seemed shorter than usual, but _so_ uncomfortable," said Meg.\
\
"Not a bit like home," added Amy.\
\
"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth, glancing,\
with full eyes, at the empty cage above her head.\
\
"Here's mother, dear, and you shall have another bird to-morrow, if you\
want it."\
\
As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as\
if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.\
\
"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another\
week of it?" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her, and the rest turned\
toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.\
\
"I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.\
\
"Nor I," echoed the others.\
\
"You think, then, that it is better to have a few duties, and live a\
little for others, do you?"\
\
"Lounging and larking doesn't pay," observed Jo, shaking her head. "I'm\
tired of it, and mean to go to work at something right off."\
\
"Suppose you learn plain cooking; that's a useful accomplishment, which\
no woman should be without," said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the\
recollection of Jo's dinner-party; for she had met Miss Crocker, and\
heard her account of it.\
\
"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd get\
on?" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.\
\
"Yes; I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing\
her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\
pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable; so I\
thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when every\
one thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help\
one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it\
comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely\
to us all?"\
\
"We do, mother, we do!" cried the girls.\
\
"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though\
they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn\
to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it\
keeps us from _ennui_ and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and\
gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or\
fashion."\
\
"We'll work like bees, and love it too; see if we don't!" said Jo. "I'll\
learn plain cooking for my holiday task; and the next dinner-party I\
have shall be a success."\
\
"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,\
Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing; that will be\
better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\
they are," said Meg.\
\
"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\
and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,"\
was Beth's resolution; while Amy followed their example by heroically\
declaring, "I shall learn to make button-holes, and attend to my parts\
of speech."\
\
"Very good! then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\
that we shall not have to repeat it; only don't go to the other extreme,\
and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play; make each\
day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of\
time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will\
bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of\
poverty."\
\
"We'll remember, mother!" and they did.\
\
                  [Illustration: We'll work like bees]\

\
\
                 [Illustration: Beth was post-mistress]\
\
Beth was post-mistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it\
regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door\
and distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full,\
and went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\
post.\
\
"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that," she said, putting\
the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in "Marmee's corner," and was\
kept supplied by the affectionate boy.\
\
"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove," continued Beth, delivering the\
articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\
\
"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one," said Meg, looking\
at the gray cotton glove.\
\
"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?"\
\
"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office."\
\
"I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My\
letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted; I think Mr.\
Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing."\
\
Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\
morning-gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very\
womanly, as she sat sewing at her little work-table, full of tidy white\
rolls; so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed\
and sung, while her fingers flew, and her thoughts were busied with\
girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that\
Mrs. March smiled, and was satisfied.\
\
"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\
the whole post-office, stuck outside," said Beth, laughing, as she went\
into the study, where Jo sat writing.\
\
"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the\
fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the\
fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\
one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show\
him I _don't_ care for the fashion;" and, hanging the antique broad-brim\
on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.\
\
One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\
to her,--\
\
    "MY DEAR:\
\
    "I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I\
    watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about\
    your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no\
    one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may\
    trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book. _I_, too, have\
    seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your\
    resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear,\
    patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one\
    sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving\
\
                                                           "MOTHER."\
\
"That does me good! that's worth millions of money and pecks of praise.\
O Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I\
have you to help me."\
\
Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy\
tears, for she _had_ thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts\
to be good; and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,\
because unexpected, and from the person whose commendation she most\
valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\
pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\
be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\
for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\
\
                "DEAR JO,\
                 What ho!\
\
    Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\
    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\
    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\
    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\
    sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things.\
    Brooke will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will\
    play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come; can't let\
    Beth off, at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don't\
    bother about rations,--I'll see to that, and everything\
    else,--only do come, there's a good fellow!\
\
                "In a tearing hurry,\
                 Yours ever, LAURIE."\
\
"Here's richness!" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.\
\
"Of course we can go, mother? it will be such a help to Laurie, for I\
can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some\
way."\
\
"I hope the Vaughns are not fine, grown-up people. Do you know anything\
about them, Jo?" asked Meg.\
\
"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and\
Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\
ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the\
way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\
Kate much."\
\
"I'm so glad my French print is clean; it's just the thing, and so\
becoming!" observed Meg complacently. "Have you anything decent, Jo?"\
\
"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and\
tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come,\
Bethy?"\
\
"If you won't let any of the boys talk to me."\
\
"Not a boy!"\
\
"I like to please Laurie; and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so\
kind; but I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work\
hard, and not trouble any one; and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll\
go."\
\
"That's my good girl; you do try to fight off your shyness, and I love\
you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know; and a cheery word\
kind of gives a lift. Thank you, mother," and Jo gave the thin cheek a\
grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the\
rosy roundness of her youth.\
\
"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy," said\
Amy, showing her mail.\
\
"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to\
him to-night, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go," added Beth,\
whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.\
\
"Now let's fly round, and do double duty to-day, so that we can play\
to-morrow with free minds," said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a\
broom.\
\
When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning, to promise\
them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation\
for the f\'eate as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\
little curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\
afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\
atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\
putting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\
was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\
drawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\
purpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\
the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\
roused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.\
\
  [Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\
                                 nose]\
\
Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\
lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept\
reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by\
frequent telegrams from the window.\
\
"There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch\
in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the\
sky, and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too. There's Laurie,\
looking like a sailor,--nice boy! Oh, mercy me! here's a carriage full\
of people--a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is\
lame; poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be\
quick, girls! it's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.\
Look, Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day, when we were\
shopping?"\
\
"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the\
Mountains. There is Sallie; I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\
right, Jo?" cried Meg, in a flutter.\
\
"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight; it looks\
sentimental tipped that way, and will fly off at the first puff. Now,\
then, come on!"\
\
"O Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd! You\
shall _not_ make a guy of yourself," remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down,\
with a red ribbon, the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned Leghorn Laurie had\
sent for a joke.\
\
"I just will, though, for it's capital,--so shady, light, and big. It\
will make fun; and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable." With\
that Jo marched straight away, and the rest followed,--a bright little\
band of sisters, all looking their best, in summer suits, with happy\
faces under the jaunty hat-brims.\
\
Laurie ran to meet, and present them to his friends, in the most cordial\
manner. The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\
lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\
though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\
do well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\
that he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie "primmed up\
his mouth" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\
stand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\
and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\
new boys, and decided that the lame one was not "dreadful," but gentle\
and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\
Grace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\
one another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.\
\
Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the\
party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving\
Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\
Mr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\
his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\
water-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\
general utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\
laugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\
rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\
shower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\
especially as she exclaimed "Christopher Columbus!" when she lost her\
oar; and Laurie said, "My dear fellow, did I hurt you?" when he tripped\
over her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\
examine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\
"odd, but rather clever," and smiled upon her from afar.\
\
              [Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]\
\
Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\
rowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\
uncommon "skill and dexterity." Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\
man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\
manners, and considered him a walking encyclop\'e6dia of useful knowledge.\
He never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\
felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\
college, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\
bounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\
altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was\
absorbed in keeping her white piqu\'e9 dress clean, and chattering with the\
ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.\
\
It was not far to Longmeadow; but the tent was pitched and the wickets\
down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three\
wide-spreading oaks in the middle, and a smooth strip of turf for\
croquet.\
\
"Welcome to Camp Laurence!" said the young host, as they landed, with\
exclamations of delight.\
\
"Brooke is commander-in-chief; I am commissary-general; the other\
fellows are staff-officers; and you, ladies, are company. The tent is\
for your especial benefit, and that oak is your drawing-room; this is\
the mess-room, and the third is the camp-kitchen. Now, let's have a game\
before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner."\
\
Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the\
other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred; Laurie took Sallie,\
Jo, and Ned. The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\
better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\
spirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\
once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\
had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\
close behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\
ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\
very near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\
toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\
\
"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first," cried\
the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.\
\
             [Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\
\
"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now," said Jo sharply.\
\
"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\
allowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake."\
\
"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose," said Jo\
angrily.\
\
"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!"\
returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.\
\
Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\
colored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\
with all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\
with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\
finding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\
and waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\
place she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\
won, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\
\
"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\
you are finished," cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\
the finish.\
\
"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies," said Jo, with\
a look that made the lad redden, "especially when they beat them," she\
added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\
stroke.\
\
Laurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\
over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\
whisper to his friend,--\
\
"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\
won't do it again, take my word for it."\
\
Meg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\
approvingly,--\
\
"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\
Jo."\
\
"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should\
certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I\
got my rage under enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now, so I\
hope he'll keep out of my way," returned Jo, biting her lips, as she\
glowered at Fred from under her big hat.\
\
"Time for lunch," said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.\
"Commissary-general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss\
March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?"\
\
"Jo can," said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that\
her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over\
the coffee-pot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys\
made a fire, and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched,\
and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes\
to serve as plates.\
\
The commander-in-chief and his aids soon spread the table-cloth with an\
inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green\
leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and every one settled\
themselves to a hearty meal; for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise\
develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was; for everything\
seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\
venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\
table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\
into the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\
being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\
what was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence,\
and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river\
with all his might and main.\
\
        [Illustration: "A very merry lunch it was."--Page 156.]\
\
"There's salt here, if you prefer it," said Laurie, as he handed Jo a\
saucer of berries.\
\
"Thank you, I prefer spiders," she replied, fishing up two unwary little\
ones who had gone to a creamy death. "How dare you remind me of that\
horrid dinner-party, when yours is so nice in every way?" added Jo,\
as they both laughed, and ate out of one plate, the china having run\
short.\
\
"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.\
This is no credit to me, you know; I don't do anything; it's you and Meg\
and Brooke who make it go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall we\
do when we can't eat any more?" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump\
card had been played when lunch was over.\
\
"Have games, till it's cooler. I brought 'Authors,' and I dare say Miss\
Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her; she's company, and\
you ought to stay with her more."\
\
"Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke; but he keeps\
talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous\
glass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for\
you can't do it, Jo."\
\
Miss Kate did know several new games; and as the girls would not, and\
the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing-room\
to play "Rigmarole."\
\
"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as\
he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when\
the next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny when well done,\
and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over.\
Please start it, Mr. Brooke," said Kate, with a commanding air, which\
surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other\
gentleman.\
\
Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke\
obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed\
upon the sunshiny river.\
\
"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\
for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He travelled a long\
while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\
came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\
one who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\
very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\
the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\
though he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\
this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\
he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\
seen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\
prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\
the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\
castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\
a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\
knight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\
could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\
see it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\
and ask how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew\
open, and he beheld--"\
\
          [Illustration: He went prancing down a quiet street]\
\
"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\
last! at last!'" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired\
the style. "''Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an\
ecstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\
fairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\
knight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\
till my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve\
salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return\
victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and\
flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he\
received--"\
\
                  [Illustration: "Oh, rise," she said]\
\
"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\
black gown fired at him," said Ned. "Instantly Sir What's-his-name\
recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\
join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door\
locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got half-way down when\
the ladder broke, and he went head first into the moat, sixty feet\
below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\
a little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\
till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\
his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\
steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\
spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top\
of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and\
chilled his blood--"\
\
       [Illustration: A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon]\
\
"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its\
wasted hand," went on Meg. "It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him\
down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor\
stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and\
the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the\
glitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained\
door, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but\
the spectre plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a--"\
\
"Snuff-box," said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\
audience. "'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch, and\
sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. 'Ha! ha!'\
laughed the ghost; and having peeped through the key-hole at the\
princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her\
victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other\
knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose\
and began to--"\
\
                       [Illustration: He sneezed]\
\
"Dance a hornpipe," cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath; "and, as they\
danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. 'Up\
with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard a lee, and man the\
guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a\
flag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my\
hearties!' says the captain; and a tremendous fight begun. Of course the\
British beat; they always do."\
\
"No, they don't!" cried Jo, aside.\
\
"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the\
schooner, whose decks were piled with dead, and whose lee-scuppers ran\
blood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosen's mate,\
take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he don't\
confess his sins double quick,' said the British captain. The Portuguese\
held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars\
cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,\
scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of\
the sea, sea, sea,' where--"\
\
            [Illustration: The Portuguese walked the plank]\
\
"Oh, gracious! what _shall_ I say?" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his\
rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together, pell-mell, nautical phrases\
and facts, out of one of his favorite books. "Well they went to the\
bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on\
finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,\
hoping to discover the mystery about them; for, being a woman, she was\
curious. By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\
you this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\
the poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So\
the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed, on opening it, to\
find no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\
by a--"\
\
"Little goose-girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field," said\
Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out. "The little girl was sorry for\
them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. 'Your\
geese will tell you, they know everything,' said the old woman. So she\
asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\
and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed--"\
\
"'Cabbages!'" continued Laurie promptly. "'Just the thing,' said the\
girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\
the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\
rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\
heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The\
knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\
learned that the princesses had spun themselves free, and all gone to be\
married, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting\
the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle\
to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\
affections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\
said he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\
proper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\
but it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\
but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\
broke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\
peeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!' But the pretty\
princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly,\
and left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell\
you."\
\
                [Illustration: Will you give me a rose?]\
\
"I can't; I'm not playing, I never do," said Frank, dismayed at the\
sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple.\
Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.\
\
"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?" asked\
Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in\
his button-hole.\
\
"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate, after a\
while," said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his\
tutor.\
\
"What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do\
something quite clever. Do you know 'Truth'?" asked Sallie, after they\
had laughed over their story.\
\
"I hope so," said Meg soberly.\
\
"The game, I mean?"\
\
"What is it?" said Fred.\
\
"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and\
the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any questions put\
by the rest. It's great fun."\
\
"Let's try it," said Jo, who liked new experiments.\
\
Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,\
and Laurie piled and drew; and the lot fell to Laurie.\
\
"Who are your heroes?" asked Jo.\
\
"Grandfather and Napoleon."\
\
"Which lady here do you think prettiest?" said Sallie.\
\
"Margaret."\
\
"Which do you like best?" from Fred.\
\
"Jo, of course."\
\
"What silly questions you ask!" and Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the\
rest laughed at Laurie's matter-of-fact tone.\
\
"Try again; Truth isn't a bad game," said Fred.\
\
"It's a very good one for you," retorted Jo, in a low voice.\
\
Her turn came next.\
\
"What is your greatest fault?" asked Fred, by way of testing in her the\
virtue he lacked himself.\
\
"A quick temper."\
\
"What do you most wish for?" said Laurie.\
\
"A pair of boot-lacings," returned Jo, guessing and defeating his\
purpose.\
\
"Not a true answer; you must say what you really do want most."\
\
"Genius; don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?" and she slyly\
smiled in his disappointed face.\
\
"What virtues do you most admire in a man?" asked Sallie.\
\
"Courage and honesty."\
\
"Now my turn," said Fred, as his hand came last.\
\
"Let's give it to him," whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded, and asked at\
once,--\
\
"Didn't you cheat at croquet?"\
\
"Well, yes, a little bit."\
\
"Good! Didn't you take your story out of 'The Sea-Lion?'" said Laurie.\
\
"Rather."\
\
"Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?" asked\
Sallie.\
\
"I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't."\
\
"He's a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance\
without waiting to draw. I'll harrow up your feelings first, by asking\
if you don't think you are something of a flirt," said Laurie, as Jo\
nodded to Fred, as a sign that peace was declared.\
\
"You impertinent boy! of course I'm not," exclaimed Sallie, with an air\
that proved the contrary.\
\
"What do you hate most?" asked Fred.\
\
"Spiders and rice-pudding."\
\
"What do you like best?" asked Jo.\
\
"Dancing and French gloves."\
\
"Well, _I_ think Truth is a very silly play; let's have a sensible game\
of Authors, to refresh our minds," proposed Jo.\
\
Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and, while it went on,\
the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her sketch\
again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass, with\
a book, which he did not read.\
\
"How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw," said Meg, with mingled\
admiration and regret in her voice.\
\
"Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent for it,"\
replied Miss Kate graciously.\
\
"I haven't time."\
\
"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine; but I\
proved to her that I had talent, by taking a few lessons privately, and\
then she was quite willing I should go on. Can't you do the same with\
your governess?"\
\
"I have none."\
\
"I forgot; young ladies in America go to school more than with us. Very\
fine schools they are, too, papa says. You go to a private one, I\
suppose?"\
\
"I don't go at all; I am a governess myself."\
\
"Oh, indeed!" said Miss Kate; but she might as well have said, "Dear me,\
how dreadful!" for her tone implied it, and something in her face made\
Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.\
\
Mr. Brooke looked up, and said quickly, "Young ladies in America love\
independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and\
respected for supporting themselves."\
\
"Oh, yes; of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so. We have\
many most respectable and worthy young women, who do the same and are\
employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of gentlemen,\
they are both well-bred and accomplished, you know," said Miss Kate, in\
a patronizing tone, that hurt Meg's pride, and made her work seem not\
only more distasteful, but degrading.\
\
"Did the German song suit, Miss March?" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an\
awkward pause.\
\
"Oh, yes! it was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever translated\
it for me;" and Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.\
\
"Don't you read German?" asked Miss Kate, with a look of surprise.\
\
"Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on\
very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation."\
\
"Try a little now; here is Schiller's 'Mary Stuart,' and a tutor who\
loves to teach," and Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap, with an\
inviting smile.\
\
"It's so hard I'm afraid to try," said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the\
presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.\
\
"I'll read a bit to encourage you;" and Miss Kate read one of the most\
beautiful passages, in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless\
manner.\
\
Mr. Brooke made no comment, as she returned the book to Meg, who said\
innocently,--\
\
"I thought it was poetry."\
\
"Some of it is. Try this passage."\
\
There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at poor\
Mary's lament.\
\
Meg, obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used\
to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of\
the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the\
page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the\
beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of\
tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown\
eyes then, she would have stopped short; but she never looked up, and\
the lesson was not spoiled for her.\
\
"Very well indeed!" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her\
many mistakes, and looking as if he did, indeed, "love to teach."\
\
Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little\
tableau before her, shut her sketch-book, saying, with condescension,--\
\
               [Illustration: Miss Kate put up her glass]\
\
"You've a nice accent, and, in time, will be a clever reader. I advise\
you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I\
must look after Grace, she is romping;" and Miss Kate strolled away,\
adding to herself, with a shrug, "I didn't come to chaperone a\
governess, though she _is_ young and pretty. What odd people these\
Yankees are; I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoilt among them."\
\
"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses,\
and don't treat them as we do," said Meg, looking after the retreating\
figure with an annoyed expression.\
\
"Tutors, also, have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my\
sorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret;"\
and Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful, that Meg was ashamed to\
lament her hard lot.\
\
"I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get a good deal\
of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain; I only wish I\
liked teaching as you do."\
\
"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry\
to lose him next year," said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the\
turf.\
\
"Going to college, I suppose?" Meg's lips asked that question, but her\
eyes added, "And what becomes of you?"\
\
"Yes; it's high time he went, for he is ready; and as soon as he is off,\
I shall turn soldier. I am needed."\
\
"I am glad of that!" exclaimed Meg. "I should think every young man\
would want to go; though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay\
at home," she added sorrowfully.\
\
"I have neither, and very few friends, to care whether I live or die,"\
said Mr. Brooke, rather bitterly, as he absently put the dead rose in\
the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.\
\
"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all\
be very sorry to have any harm happen to you," said Meg heartily.\
\
"Thank you; that sounds pleasant," began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful\
again; but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old\
horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the\
young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.\
\
"Don't you love to ride?" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting,\
after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.\
\
"I dote upon it; my sister Meg used to ride when papa was rich, but we\
don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree," added Amy, laughing.\
\
"Tell me about Ellen Tree; is it a donkey?" asked Grace curiously.\
\
                       [Illustration: Ellen Tree]\
\
"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses, and so am I, but we've only got\
an old side-saddle, and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple-tree,\
that has a nice low branch; so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some reins\
on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we\
like."\
\
"How funny!" laughed Grace. "I have a pony at home, and ride nearly\
every day in the park, with Fred and Kate; it's very nice, for my\
friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen."\
\
"Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day; but I'd rather\
go to Rome than the Row," said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what\
the Row was, and wouldn't have asked for the world.\
\
Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were\
saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as\
he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical\
gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author-cards, looked\
up, and said, in her shy yet friendly way,--\
\
"I'm afraid you are tired; can I do anything for you?"\
\
"Talk to me, please; it's dull, sitting by myself," answered Frank, who\
had evidently been used to being made much of at home.\
\
If he had asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed\
a more impossible task to bashful Beth; but there was no place to run\
to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at\
her, that she bravely resolved to try.\
\
"What do you like to talk about?" she asked, fumbling over the cards,\
and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.\
\
"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting," said\
Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.\
\
"My heart! what shall I do? I don't know anything about them," thought\
Beth; and, forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,\
hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you\
know all about it."\
\
"I did once; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a\
confounded five-barred gate; so there are no more horses and hounds for\
me," said Frank, with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her\
innocent blunder.\
\
"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes," she said, turning\
to the prairies for help, and feeling glad that she had read one of the\
boys' books in which Jo delighted.\
\
Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory; and, in her eagerness to\
amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her\
sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking\
away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged\
protection.\
\
"Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him," said Jo,\
beaming at her from the croquet-ground.\
\
"I always said she was a little saint," added Meg, as if there could be\
no further doubt of it.\
\
"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long," said Grace to\
Amy, as they sat discussing dolls, and making tea-sets out of the\
acorn-cups.\
\
"My sister Beth is a very _fastidious_ girl, when she likes to be," said\
Amy, well pleased at Beth's success. She meant "fascinating," but as\
Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, "fastidious" sounded\
well, and made a good impression.\
\
An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet,\
finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,\
wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the\
river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,\
warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain,--\
\
        "Alone, alone, ah! woe, alone,"\
\
and at the lines--\
\
       "We each are young, we each have a heart,\
        Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?"\
\
he looked at Meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed\
outright and spoilt his song.\
\
"How can you be so cruel to me?" he whispered, under cover of a lively\
chorus. "You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day, and\
now you snub me."\
\
"I didn't mean to; but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,"\
replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach; for it was\
quite true that she _had_ shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and\
the talk after it.\
\
Ned was offended, and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her\
rather pettishly, "There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?"\
\
"Not a particle; but she's a dear," returned Sallie, defending her\
friend even while confessing her short-comings.\
\
"She's not a stricken deer, any way," said Ned, trying to be witty, and\
succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.\
\
On the lawn, where it had gathered, the little party separated with\
cordial good-nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.\
As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after\
them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, "In spite of\
their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when one knows\
them."\
\
"I quite agree with you," said Mr. Brooke.\

\
                          CASTLES IN THE AIR.\
\
\
Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock, one warm\
September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too\
lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods; for the day had\
been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could\
live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\
shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\
displeased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon, frightened\
the maid-servants half out of their wits, by mischievously hinting that\
one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stable-man\
about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\
hammock, to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\
peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into\
the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams\
of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean, in a\
voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a\
flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches\
coming out, as if bound on some expedition.\
\
"What in the world are those girls about now?" thought Laurie, opening\
his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather\
peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping\
hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long\
staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio.\
All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and\
began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.\
\
"Well, that's cool!" said Laurie to himself, "to have a picnic and never\
ask me. They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got the key.\
Perhaps they forgot it; I'll take it to them, and see what's going on."\
\
Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find\
one; then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in\
his pocket; so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the\
fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boat-house, he\
waited for them to appear: but no one came, and he went up the hill to\
take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from\
the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of\
the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\
\
"Here's a landscape!" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\
looking wide-awake and good-natured already.\
\
It _was_ rather a pretty little picture; for the sisters sat together in\
the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic\
wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little\
wood-people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers,\
but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her\
white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose, in her pink\
dress, among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under\
the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things of them. Amy was\
sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A\
shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he\
ought to go away, because uninvited; yet lingering, because home seemed\
very lonely, and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his\
restless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its\
harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and\
skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the\
wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.\
\
          [Illustration: It was rather a pretty little picture]\
\
"May I come in, please? or shall I be a bother?" he asked, advancing\
slowly.\
\
Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly, and said, at\
once, "Of course you may. We should have asked you before, only we\
thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this."\
\
"I always liked your games; but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away."\
\
"I've no objection, if you do something; it's against the rules to be\
idle here," replied Meg, gravely but graciously.\
\
"Much obliged; I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's as\
dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw,\
or do all at once? Bring on your bears; I'm ready," and Laurie sat down,\
with a submissive expression delightful to behold.\
\
"Finish this story while I set my heel," said Jo, handing him the book.\
\
"Yes'm," was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his\
gratitude for the favor of an admission into the "Busy Bee Society."\
\
The story was not a long one, and, when it was finished, he ventured to\
ask a few questions as a reward of merit.\
\
"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming\
institution is a new one?"\
\
"Would you tell him?" asked Meg of her sisters.\
\
"He'll laugh," said Amy warningly.\
\
"Who cares?" said Jo.\
\
"I guess he'll like it," added Beth.\
\
"Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away, Jo, and\
don't be afraid."\
\
"The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play\
'Pilgrim's Progress,' and we have been going on with it in earnest, all\
winter and summer."\
\
"Yes, I know," said Laurie, nodding wisely.\
\
"Who told you?" demanded Jo.\
\
"Spirits."\
\
"No, I did; I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and\
he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold, Jo," said Beth\
meekly.\
\
"You can't keep a secret. Never mind; it saves trouble now."\
\
"Go on, please," said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking\
a trifle displeased.\
\
"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have\
tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task, and worked at\
it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\
and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."\
\
"Yes, I should think so;" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle\
days.\
\
"Mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible; so we bring\
our work here, and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our\
things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\
and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the\
'Delectable Mountain,' for we can look far away and see the country\
where we hope to live some time."\
\
Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine; for through an opening in the\
wood one could look across the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\
other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills\
that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens plowed with\
the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the\
hill-tops; and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white\
peaks, that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\
\
"How beautiful that is!" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and\
feel beauty of any kind.\
\
"It's often so; and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\
always splendid," replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\
\
"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time,--the real\
country, she means, with pigs and chickens, and haymaking. It would be\
nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\
ever go to it," said Beth musingly.\
\
"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we _shall_ go, by and\
by, when we are good enough," answered Meg, with her sweet voice.\
\
"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do; I want to fly away at once, as\
those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate."\
\
"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later; no fear of that," said Jo;\
"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\
maybe never get in after all."\
\
"You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall have to do a\
deal of travelling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I\
arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?"\
\
Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend; but she said\
cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, "If people\
really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get\
in; for I don't believe there are any locks on that door, or any guards\
at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the\
shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he\
comes up from the river."\
\
"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\
come true, and we could live in them?" said Jo, after a little pause.\
\
"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,"\
said Laurie, lying flat, and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\
betrayed him.\
\
"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?" asked Meg.\
\
"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"\
\
"Yes, if the girls will too."\
\
"We will. Now, Laurie."\
\
"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in\
Germany, and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous\
musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me; and I'm never\
to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself, and live\
for what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?"\
\
Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake\
before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said\
slowly, "I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious\
things,--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people,\
and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like,\
with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy\
it! for I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and make every one love me\
dearly."\
\
             [Illustration: Waved a brake before her face]\
\
"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?" asked Laurie\
slyly.\
\
"I said 'pleasant people,' you know;" and Meg carefully tied up her shoe\
as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.\
\
"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband, and some\
angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be perfect\
without," said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\
scorned romance, except in books.\
\
"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,"\
answered Meg petulantly.\
\
"Wouldn't I, though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\
piled with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that my\
works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something\
splendid before I go into my castle,--something heroic or wonderful,\
that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on\
the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all, some day. I think I\
shall write books, and get rich and famous: that would suit me, so that\
is _my_ favorite dream."\
\
"Mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother, and help take care\
of the family," said Beth contentedly.\
\
"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked Laurie.\
\
"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we\
may all keep well and be together; nothing else."\
\
"I have ever so many wishes; but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\
to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\
world," was Amy's modest desire.\
\
"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to\
be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of\
us will ever get our wishes," said Laurie, chewing grass, like a\
meditative calf.\
\
"I've got the key to my castle in the air; but whether I can unlock the\
door remains to be seen," observed Jo mysteriously.\
\
"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college!"\
muttered Laurie, with an impatient sigh.\
\
"Here's mine!" and Amy waved her pencil.\
\
"I haven't got any," said Meg forlornly.\
\
"Yes, you have," said Laurie at once.\
\
"Where?"\
\
"In your face."\
\
"Nonsense; that's of no use."\
\
"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having," replied\
the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\
fancied he knew.\
\
Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions, and looked across\
the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn\
when he told the story of the knight.\
\
"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of us\
have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now," said Jo,\
always ready with a plan.\
\
"Bless me! how old I shall be,--twenty-seven!" exclaimed Meg who felt\
grown up already, having just reached seventeen.\
\
"You and I shall be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy\
twenty-two. What a venerable party!" said Jo.\
\
"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time; but I'm\
such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall 'dawdle,' Jo."\
\
"You need a motive, mother says; and when you get it, she is sure you'll\
work splendidly."\
\
"Is she? By Jupiter I will, if I only get the chance!" cried Laurie,\
sitting up with sudden energy. "I ought to be satisfied to please\
grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\
and comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I'd\
rather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\
rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\
bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I\
give him four years he ought to let me off from the business; but he's\
set, and I 've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please\
myself, as my father did. If there was any one left to stay with the old\
gentleman, I'd do it to-morrow."\
\
Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\
execution on the slightest provocation; for he was growing up very fast,\
and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\
subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\
\
"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\
again till you have tried your own way," said Jo, whose imagination was\
fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\
excited by what she called "Teddy's wrongs."\
\
"That's not right, Jo; you mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie mustn't\
take your bad advice. You should do just what your grandfather wishes,\
my dear boy," said Meg, in her most maternal tone. "Do your best at\
college, and, when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't\
be hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with\
and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without\
his permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty; and you'll\
get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved."\
\
"What do you know about him?" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\
advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\
from himself, after his unusual outbreak.\
\
"Only what your grandpa told us about him,--how he took good care of his\
own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\
person, because he wouldn't leave her; and how he provides now for an\
old woman who nursed his mother; and never tells any one, but is just as\
generous and patient and good as he can be."\
\
"So he is, dear old fellow!" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\
looking flushed and earnest with her story. "It's like grandpa to find\
out all about him, without letting him know, and to tell all his\
goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\
understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me,\
and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just\
perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you\
all in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for\
Brooke."\
\
"Begin to do something now, by not plaguing his life out," said Meg\
sharply.\
\
"How do you know I do, miss?"\
\
"I can always tell by his face, when he goes away. If you have been\
good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him,\
he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\
better."\
\
"Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\
Brooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window,\
but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph."\
\
                [Illustration: I see him bow and smile]\
\
"We haven't; don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything! It\
was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is\
said in confidence, you know," cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of\
what might follow from her careless speech.\
\
"_I_ don't tell tales," replied Laurie, with his "high and mighty" air,\
as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. "Only if\
Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather\
for him to report."\
\
"Please don't be offended. I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\
silly; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be\
sorry for, by and by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our\
brother, and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly." And\
Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.\
\
Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\
and said frankly, "I'm the one to be forgiven; I'm cross, and have been\
out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be\
sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes; I thank you all the\
same."\
\
Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\
as possible,--wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\
down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\
fit person to belong to the "Busy Bee Society." In the midst of an\
animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\
amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of\
a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea "to draw," and they would\
just have time to get home to supper.\
\
"May I come again?" asked Laurie.\
\
"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are\
told to do," said Meg smiling.\
\
"I'll try."\
\
"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do;\
there's a demand for socks just now," added Jo, waving hers, like a big\
blue worsted banner, as they parted at the gate.\
\
That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,\
standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,\
whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old\
man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of\
the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of the\
afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\
sacrifice cheerfully, "I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old\
gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has."\

\
                                  XIV.\
\
                                SECRETS.\
\
\
Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\
chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun\
lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\
writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\
while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\
by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\
his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\
last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and\
threw down her pen, exclaiming,--\
\
"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till\
I can do better."\
\
Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\
making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\
which looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red\
ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,\
which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here\
was an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her\
papers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being\
likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of\
such books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin\
receptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her\
pocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her\
pens and taste her ink.\
\
She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to\
the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\
herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\
Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\
away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.\
\
If any one had been watching her, he would have thought her movements\
decidedly peculiar; for, on alighting, she went off at a great pace till\
she reached a certain number in a certain busy street; having found the\
place with some difficulty, she went into the door-way, looked up the\
dirty stairs, and, after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived\
into the street, and walked away as rapidly as she came. This\
man\'9cuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\
black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\
opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\
pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\
she were going to have all her teeth out.\
\
There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\
and, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\
opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\
gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\
in the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--\
\
"It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some\
one to help her home."\
\
In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the\
general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\
ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked\
anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking\
with an air of sympathy,--\
\
"Did you have a bad time?"\
\
"Not very."\
\
"You got through quickly."\
\
"Yes, thank goodness!"\
\
"Why did you go alone?"\
\
"Didn't want any one to know."\
\
"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?"\
\
Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to\
laugh, as if mightily amused at something.\
\
"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week."\
\
"What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo," said\
Laurie, looking mystified.\
\
"So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?"\
\
"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\
gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."\
\
"I'm glad of that."\
\
"Why?"\
\
"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and\
we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."\
\
Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several\
passers-by smile in spite of themselves.\
\
"I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will\
straighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only\
reason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?"\
\
"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you\
never go to such places. Do you?"\
\
"Not often."\
\
"I wish you wouldn't."\
\
"It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless you\
have good players; so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have a\
game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."\
\
"Oh dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,\
and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did\
hope you'd stay respectable, and be a satisfaction to your friends,"\
said Jo, shaking her head.\
\
"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without\
losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking nettled.\
\
"That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned and his\
set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him at our\
house, though he wants to come; and if you grow like him she won't be\
willing to have us frolic together as we do now."\
\
"Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.\
\
"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in\
bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."\
\
"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet; I'm not a fashionable\
party, and don't mean to be; but I do like harmless larks now and then,\
don't you?"\
\
"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you? or\
there will be an end of all our good times."\
\
"I'll be a double-distilled saint."\
\
"I can't bear saints: just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and\
we'll never desert you. I don't know what I _should_ do if you acted\
like Mr. King's son; he had plenty of money, but didn't know how to\
spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his\
father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid."\
\
"You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged."\
\
"No, I don't--oh, _dear_, no!--but I hear people talking about money\
being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor; I shouldn't\
worry then."\
\
"Do you worry about me, Jo?"\
\
"A little, when you look moody or discontented, as you sometimes do; for\
you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm afraid\
it would be hard to stop you."\
\
Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\
had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips still\
smiled as if at her warnings.\
\
"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?" he asked\
presently.\
\
"Of course not; why?"\
\
"Because if you are, I'll take a 'bus; if you are not, I'd like to walk\
with you, and tell you something very interesting."\
\
"I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely."\
\
"Very well, then; come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must\
tell me yours."\
\
"I haven't got any," began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that\
she had.\
\
"You know you have,--you can't hide anything; so up and 'fess, or I\
won't tell," cried Laurie.\
\
"Is your secret a nice one?"\
\
"Oh, isn't it! all about people you know, and such fun! You ought to\
hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you\
begin."\
\
"You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?"\
\
"Not a word."\
\
"And you won't tease me in private?"\
\
"I never tease."\
\
"Yes, you do; you get everything you want out of people. I don't know\
how you do it, but you are a born wheedler."\
\
"Thank you; fire away."\
\
"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaper man, and he's to give his\
answer next week," whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.\
\
"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!" cried\
Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight\
of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children; for\
they were out of the city now.\
\
                 [Illustration: Hurrah for Miss March]\
\
"Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say; but I couldn't rest till I\
had tried, and I said nothing about it, because I didn't want any one\
else to be disappointed."\
\
"It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare,\
compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be\
fun to see them in print; and sha'n't we feel proud of our authoress?"\
\
Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in; and a\
friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.\
\
"Where's _your_ secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you\
again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed\
up at a word of encouragement.\
\
"I may get into a scrape for telling; but I didn't promise not to, so I\
will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit\
of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is."\
\
"Is that all?" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and\
twinkled, with a face full of mysterious intelligence.\
\
"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you\
where it is."\
\
"Tell, then."\
\
Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a\
comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both\
surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, "How do you\
know?"\
\
"Saw it."\
\
"Where?"\
\
"Pocket."\
\
"All this time?"\
\
"Yes; isn't that romantic?"\
\
"No, it's horrid."\
\
"Don't you like it?"\
\
"Of course I don't. It's ridiculous; it won't be allowed. My patience!\
what would Meg say?"\
\
"You are not to tell any one; mind that."\
\
"I didn't promise."\
\
"That was understood, and I trusted you."\
\
"Well, I won't for the present, any way; but I'm disgusted, and wish you\
hadn't told me."\
\
"I thought you'd be pleased."\
\
"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you."\
\
"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away."\
\
"I'd like to see any one try it," cried Jo fiercely.\
\
"So should I!" and Laurie chuckled at the idea.\
\
"I don't think secrets agree with me; I feel rumpled up in my mind since\
you told me that," said Jo, rather ungratefully.\
\
"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right," suggested\
Laurie.\
\
No one was in sight; the smooth road sloped invitingly before her; and\
finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat\
and comb behind her, and scattering hair-pins as she ran. Laurie reached\
the goal first, and was quite satisfied with the success of his\
treatment; for his Atalanta came panting up, with flying hair, bright\
eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.\
\
                     [Illustration: Jo darted away]\
\
"I wish I was a horse; then I could run for miles in this splendid air,\
and not lose my breath. It was capital; but see what a guy it's made me.\
Go, pick up my things, like a cherub as you are," said Jo, dropping down\
under a maple-tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.\
\
Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled\
up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But\
some one did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly\
ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.\
\
"What in the world are you doing here?" she asked, regarding her\
dishevelled sister with well-bred surprise.\
\
"Getting leaves," meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had\
just swept up.\
\
"And hair-pins," added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.\
"They grow on this road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats."\
\
"You have been running, Jo; how could you? When _will_ you stop such\
romping ways?" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs, and\
smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.\
\
"Never till I'm stiff and old, and have to use a crutch. Don't try to\
make me grow up before my time, Meg: it's hard enough to have you change\
all of a sudden; let me be a little girl as long as I can."\
\
As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips;\
for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman,\
and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come\
some time, and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face, and\
drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, "Where have you been\
calling, all so fine?"\
\
"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\
Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the\
winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!"\
\
"Do you envy her, Meg?" said Laurie.\
\
"I'm afraid I do."\
\
"I'm glad of it!" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\
\
"Why?" asked Meg, looking surprised.\
\
"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\
poor man," said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\
mind what she said.\
\
"I shall never '_go_ and marry' any one," observed Meg, walking on with\
great dignity, while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping\
stones, and "behaving like children," as Meg said to herself, though she\
might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress\
on.\
\
For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite\
bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang; was rude to\
Mr. Brooke whenever they met; would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone\
face, occasionally jumping up to shake, and then to kiss her, in a very\
mysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one\
another, and talking about "Spread Eagles," till the girls declared they\
had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the\
window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the\
sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden, and finally capturing\
her in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see; but shrieks\
of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great\
flapping of newspapers.\
\
"What shall we do with that girl? She never _will_ behave like a young\
lady," sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\
\
"I hope she won't; she is so funny and dear as she is," said Beth, who\
had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets\
with any one but her.\
\
"It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_," added Amy,\
who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\
very becoming way,--two agreeable things, which made her feel unusually\
elegant and ladylike.\
\
In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\
to read.\
\
    [Illustration: Jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read]\
\
"Have you anything interesting there?" asked Meg, with condescension.\
\
"Nothing but a story; won't amount to much, I guess," returned Jo,\
carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\
\
"You'd better read it aloud; that will amuse us and keep you out of\
mischief," said Amy, in her most grown-up tone.\
\
"What's the name?" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the\
sheet.\
\
"The Rival Painters."\
\
"That sounds well; read it," said Meg.\
\
With a loud "Hem!" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The\
girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat\
pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.\
\
"I like that about the splendid picture," was Amy's approving remark, as\
Jo paused.\
\
"I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\
names; isn't that queer?" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the "lovering\
part" was tragical.\
\
"Who wrote it?" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.\
\
The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\
countenance, and, with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement,\
replied in a loud voice, "Your sister."\
\
"You?" cried Meg, dropping her work.\
\
"It's very good," said Amy critically.\
\
"I knew it! I knew it! O my Jo, I _am_ so proud!" and Beth ran to hug\
her sister, and exult over this splendid success.\
\
Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! how Meg wouldn't\
believe it till she saw the words, "Miss Josephine March," actually\
printed in the paper; how graciously Amy criticised the artistic parts\
of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\
couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead; how Beth got\
excited, and skipped and sung with joy; how Hannah came in to exclaim\
"Sakes alive, well I never!" in great astonishment at "that Jo's\
doin's;" how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it; how Jo laughed, with\
tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and\
done with it; and how the "Spread Eagle" might be said to flap his wings\
triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to\
hand.\
\
"Tell us all about it." "When did it come?" "How much did you get for\
it?" "What _will_ father say?" "Won't Laurie laugh?" cried the family,\
all in one breath, as they clustered about Jo; for these foolish,\
affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.\
\
"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything," said Jo,\
wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her "Evelina" than she\
did over her "Rival Painters." Having told how she disposed of her\
tales, Jo added, "And when I went to get my answer, the man said he\
liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his\
paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said; and when\
the beginners improved, any one would pay. So I let him have the two\
stories, and to-day this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it,\
and insisted on seeing it, so I let him; and he said it was good, and I\
shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I _am_ so\
happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls."\
\
Jo's breath gave out here; and, wrapping her head in the paper, she\
bedewed her little story with a few natural tears; for to be\
independent, and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest\
wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that\
happy end.\

\
                              A TELEGRAM.\
\
\
  [Illustration: November is the most disagreeable month in the year]\
\
"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year," said\
Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the\
frost-bitten garden.\
\
"That's the reason I was born in it," observed Jo pensively, quite\
unconscious of the blot on her nose.\
\
"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a\
delightful month," said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything,\
even November.\
\
"I dare say; but nothing pleasant ever _does_ happen in this family,"\
said Meg, who was out of sorts. "We go grubbing along day after day,\
without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as well be in a\
treadmill."\
\
"My patience, how blue we are!" cried Jo. "I don't much wonder, poor\
dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind,\
grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I wish I could manage things for\
you as I do for my heroines! You're pretty enough and good enough\
already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune\
unexpectedly; then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn every one who\
has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something, in a blaze\
of splendor and elegance."\
\
"People don't have fortunes left them in that style now-a-days; men have\
to work, and women to marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust world,"\
said Meg bitterly.\
\
"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all; just wait ten years,\
and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a corner, making mud pies, as\
Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.\
\
"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt, though\
I'm grateful for your good intentions."\
\
Meg sighed, and turned to the frost-bitten garden again; Jo groaned, and\
leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy\
spatted away energetically; and Beth, who sat at the other window, said,\
smiling, "Two pleasant things are going to happen right away: Marmee is\
coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if\
he had something nice to tell."\
\
In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, "Any letter from\
father, girls?" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, "Won't some of\
you come for a drive? I've been working away at mathematics till my head\
is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. It's a\
dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke home, so\
it will be gay inside, if it isn't out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go,\
won't you?"\
\
"Of course we will."\
\
"Much obliged, but I'm busy;" and Meg whisked out her work-basket, for\
she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not\
to drive often with the young gentleman.\
\
"We three will be ready in a minute," cried Amy, running away to wash\
her hands.\
\
"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?" asked Laurie, leaning over\
Mrs. March's chair, with the affectionate look and tone he always gave\
her.\
\
"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear.\
It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been. Father is as\
regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps."\
\
A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a\
letter.\
\
"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum," she said, handing it as\
if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.\
\
          [Illustration: One of them horrid telegraph things]\
\
At the word "telegraph," Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it\
contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little\
paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed down stairs for\
water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a\
frightened voice,--\
\
    "MRS. MARCH:\
\
    "Your husband is very ill. Come at once.\
                           "S. HALE,\
                "Blank Hospital, Washington"\
\
How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the\
day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change,\
as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the\
happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.\
Mrs. March was herself again directly; read the message over, and\
stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never\
forgot, "I shall go at once, but it may be too late. O children,\
children, help me to bear it!"\
\
For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the\
room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,\
and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first\
to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good\
example; for, with her, work was the panacea for most afflictions.\
\
"The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a cryin', but git\
your things ready right away, mum," she said, heartily, as she wiped her\
face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her\
own hard one, and went away, to work like three women in one.\
\
"She's right; there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me\
think."\
\
They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking\
pale, but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.\
\
"Where's Laurie?" she asked presently, when she had collected her\
thoughts, and decided on the first duties to be done.\
\
"Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something!" cried the boy, hurrying from the\
next room, whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was\
too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.\
\
"Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early\
in the morning. I'll take that."\
\
"What else? The horses are ready; I can go anywhere, do anything," he\
said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.\
\
"Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and paper."\
\
Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the\
table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad\
journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add\
a little to the sum for her father.\
\
"Now go, dear; but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace;\
there is no need of that."\
\
Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away; for five minutes later\
Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his\
life.\
\
"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way\
get these things. I'll put them down; they'll be needed, and I must go\
prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go and\
ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine: I'm not too proud\
to beg for father; he shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell\
Hannah to get down the black trunk; and, Meg, come and help me find my\
things, for I'm half bewildered."\
\
Writing, thinking, and directing, all at once, might well bewilder the\
poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little\
while, and let them work. Every one scattered like leaves before a gust\
of wind; and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if\
the paper had been an evil spell.\
\
Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the\
kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest\
promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which\
comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn't offer, from his own\
dressing-gown to himself as escort. But that last was impossible. Mrs.\
March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long\
journey; yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,\
for anxiety ill fits one for travelling. He saw the look, knit his heavy\
eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be\
back directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran\
through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea\
in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.\
\
           [Illustration: She came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke]\
\
"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March," he said, in the kind,\
quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. "I\
came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has\
commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction\
to be of service to her there."\
\
Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg\
put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude, that Mr. Brooke\
would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling\
one of time and comfort which he was about to make.\
\
"How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure; and it will be such\
a relief to know that she has some one to take care of her. Thank you\
very, very much!"\
\
Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the\
brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and\
lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.\
\
Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from\
Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what\
she had often said before,--that she had always told them it was absurd\
for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come\
of it, and she hoped they would take her advice next time. Mrs. March\
put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her\
preparations, with her lips folded tightly, in a way which Jo would have\
understood if she had been there.\
\
The short afternoon wore away; all the other errands were done, and Meg\
and her mother busy at some necessary needle-work, while Beth and Amy\
got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a "slap\
and a bang," but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious; and\
Laurie went off to find her, for no one ever knew what freak Jo might\
take into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in with\
a very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun\
and fear, satisfaction and regret, in it, which puzzled the family as\
much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying, with a\
little choke in her voice, "That's my contribution towards making\
father comfortable and bringing him home!"\
\
"My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you\
haven't done anything rash?\
\
"No, it's mine honestly; I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it;\
and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own."\
\
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for\
all her abundant hair was cut short.\
\
"Your hair! Your beautiful hair!" "O Jo, how could you? Your one\
beauty." "My dear girl, there was no need of this." "She doesn't look\
like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!"\
\
As every one exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo\
assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive any one a particle,\
and said, rumpling up the brown bush, and trying to look as if she liked\
it, "It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth. It\
will be good for my vanity; I was getting too proud of my wig. It will\
do my brains good to have that mop taken off; my head feels deliciously\
light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop,\
which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm\
satisfied; so please take the money, and let's have supper."\
\
"Tell me all about it, Jo. _I_ am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame\
you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call\
it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid you\
will regret it, one of these days," said Mrs. March.\
\
"No, I won't!" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank\
was not entirely condemned.\
\
"What made you do it?" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of\
cutting off her head as her pretty hair.\
\
"Well, I was wild to do something for father," replied Jo, as they\
gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the\
midst of trouble. "I hate to borrow as much as mother does, and I knew\
Aunt March would croak; she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. Meg\
gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some\
clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,\
if I sold the nose off my face to get it."\
\
"You needn't feel wicked, my child: you had no winter things, and got\
the simplest with your own hard earnings," said Mrs. March, with a look\
that warmed Jo's heart.\
\
"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went\
along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to\
dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber's window\
I saw tails of hair with the prices marked; and one black tail, not so\
thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came over me all of a sudden that I\
had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I\
walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for\
mine."\
\
"I don't see how you dared to do it," said Beth, in a tone of awe.\
\
"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his\
hair. He rather stared, at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls\
bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn't\
care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid much\
for it in the first place; the work put into it made it dear, and so on.\
It was getting late, and I was afraid, if it wasn't done right away,\
that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a\
thing, I hate to give it up; so I begged him to take it, and told him\
why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his\
mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy\
way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly,--\
\
"'Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady; I'd do as much for our\
Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.'"\
\
"Who was Jimmy?" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they\
went along.\
\
"Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make\
strangers feel, don't they? She talked away all the time the man\
clipped, and diverted my mind nicely."\
\
                    [Illustration: The man clipped]\
\
"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?" asked Meg, with a\
shiver.\
\
"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that\
was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that; I will\
confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on\
the table, and felt only the short, rough ends on my head. It almost\
seemed as if I'd an arm or a leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and\
picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give it to you, Marmee, just\
to remember past glories by; for a crop is so comfortable I don't think\
I shall ever have a mane again."\
\
Mrs. March folded the wavy, chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short\
gray one in her desk. She only said "Thank you, deary," but something in\
her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as\
they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day\
to-morrow, and the happy times they would have when father came home to\
be nursed.\
\
No one wanted to go to bed, when, at ten o'clock, Mrs. March put by the\
last finished job, and said, "Come, girls." Beth went to the piano and\
played the father's favorite hymn; all began bravely, but broke down\
one by one, till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to\
her music was always a sweet consoler.\
\
"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early, and shall need all\
the sleep we can get. Good-night, my darlings," said Mrs. March, as the\
hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.\
\
They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear\
invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of\
the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts\
she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister\
fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she\
touched a wet cheek,--\
\
"Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?"\
\
"No, not now."\
\
"What then?"\
\
"My--my hair!" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion\
in the pillow.\
\
It did not sound at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the\
afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.\
\
"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choke. "I'd do it again to-morrow,\
if I could. It's only the vain, selfish part of me that goes and cries\
in this silly way. Don't tell any one, it's all over now. I thought you\
were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty. How\
came you to be awake?"\
\
"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," said Meg.\
\
"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."\
\
"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."\
\
"What did you think of?"\
\
"Handsome faces,--eyes particularly," answered Meg, smiling to herself,\
in the dark.\
\
"What color do you like best?"\
\
"Brown--that is, sometimes; blue are lovely."\
\
Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably\
promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in\
her castle in the air.\
\
The clocks were striking midnight, and the rooms were very still, as a\
figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlid here,\
settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each\
unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to\
pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she lifted the\
curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from\
behind the clouds, and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,\
which seemed to whisper in the silence, "Be comforted, dear soul! There\
is always light behind the clouds."\

\
                                LETTERS.\
\
\
In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp, and read their chapter\
with an earnestness never felt before; for now the shadow of a real\
trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort; and,\
as they dressed, they agreed to say good-by cheerfully and hopefully,\
and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or\
complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went\
down,--so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.\
Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face\
looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her night-cap on.\
The big trunk stood ready in the hall, mother's cloak and bonnet lay on\
the sofa, and mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and\
worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to\
keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself; Jo\
was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once; and\
the little girls' wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a\
new experience to them.\
\
Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near, and they sat waiting\
for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied\
about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of\
her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up\
her travelling bag,--\
\
"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection.\
Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as\
if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you\
should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone,\
or think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to\
forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace.\
Hope and keep busy; and whatever happens, remember that you never can be\
fatherless."\
\
"Yes, mother."\
\
"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in\
any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get despondent\
or do rash things; write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to\
help and cheer us all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be\
faithful to the little home duties; and you, Amy, help all you can, be\
obedient, and keep happy safe at home."\
\
"We will, mother! we will!"\
\
The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.\
That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well: no one cried, no\
one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very\
heavy as they sent loving messages to father, remembering, as they\
spoke, that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their\
mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands\
cheerfully when she drove away.\
\
Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke\
looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him\
"Mr. Greatheart" on the spot.\
\
"Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!" whispered Mrs. March,\
as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the\
carriage.\
\
As she rolled away, the sun came out, and, looking back, she saw it\
shining on the group at the gate, like a good omen. They saw it also,\
and smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld, as she\
turned the corner, was the four bright faces, and behind them, like a\
body-guard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.\
\
                    [Illustration: She rolled away]\
\
"How kind every one is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh proof of\
it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.\
\
"I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so\
infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling; and so the long\
journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful\
words.\
\
"I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their neighbors\
went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.\
\
"It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg forlornly.\
\
Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile\
of nicely-mended hose which lay on mother's table, showing that even in\
her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a\
little thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and, in spite of\
their brave resolutions, they all broke down, and cried bitterly.\
\
Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and, when the\
shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a\
coffee-pot.\
\
"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret.\
Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work,\
and be a credit to the family."\
\
Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that\
morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant\
invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee-pot. They drew up to the\
table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes\
were all right again.\
\
"'Hope and keep busy;' that's the motto for us, so let's see who will\
remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she\
lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.\
\
"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend\
to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red.\
\
"No need of that; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well," put in Amy,\
with an important air.\
\
"Hannah will tell us what to do; and we'll have everything nice when you\
come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish-tub without delay.\
\
"I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating sugar,\
pensively.\
\
The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg\
shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a\
sugar-bowl.\
\
The sight of the turn-overs made Jo sober again; and when the two went\
out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window\
where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone; but\
Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was,\
nodding away at them like a rosy-faced mandarin.\
\
"That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face.\
"Good-by, Meggy; I hope the Kings won't train to-day. Don't fret about\
father, dear," she added, as they parted.\
\
"And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair _is_ becoming, and it\
looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to smile at the\
curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.\
\
"That's my only comfort;" and, touching her hat _\'e0 la_ Laurie, away went\
Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.\
\
News from their father comforted the girls very much; for, though\
dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had\
already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and, as the\
head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the despatches, which grew\
more and more cheering as the week passed. At first, every one was eager\
to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter-box\
by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their\
Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained\
characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and\
read them:--\
\
    "MY DEAREST MOTHER,--\
\
    "It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made\
    us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and\
    crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate\
    that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long,\
    since he is so useful to you and father. The girls are all as\
    good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing\
    all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if\
    I didn't know that her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is\
    as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what\
    you told her. She grieves about father, and looks sober except\
    when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I\
    take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am\
    teaching her to make button-holes and mend her stockings. She\
    tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her\
    improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a\
    motherly old hen, as Jo says; and Laurie is very kind and\
    neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue\
    sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah\
    is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and always calls\
    me Miss 'Margaret,' which is quite proper, you know, and treats\
    me with respect. We are all well and busy; but we long, day\
    and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to father,\
    and believe me, ever your own\
                                                              "MEG."\
\
This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to\
the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,\
ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed\
letters:--\
\
    "MY PRECIOUS MARMEE,--\
\
    "Three cheers for dear father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph\
    right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed\
    up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for\
    being so good to us; but I could only cry, and say, 'I'm glad!\
    I'm glad!' Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? for I\
    felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and\
    now I can enjoy them, for every one is so desperately good,\
    it's like living in a nest of turtle-doves. You'd laugh to see\
    Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier\
    every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are\
    regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be\
    anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a\
    quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little\
    thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I\
    ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till\
    I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't, and got mad. It lasted\
    all day; I felt bad, and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are\
    both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon; but I thought he'd come\
    to it, for I _was_ in the right. He didn't come; and just at\
    night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.\
    I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun\
    set on _my_ anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I\
    met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both\
    laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and\
    comfortable again.\
\
    "I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and,\
    as father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse\
    him. Give him the lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself\
    a dozen times for your\

    "DEAR MIS MARCH,--\
\
    "I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is\
    clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a\
    proper good housekeeper; she hes the liking for it, and gits\
    the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin\
    ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never\
    know where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of\
    clothes on Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was\
    wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should\
    a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a\
    sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She\
    tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her\
    years; likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful.\
    We have got on very economical so fur; I don't let the girls\
    hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em\
    on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well about frettin, wearin\
    her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full\
    of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent;\
    but he heartens up the girls, and so I let em hev full swing.\
    The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin,\
    but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is\
    riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and\
    hope he's seen the last of his Pewmonia.\

\
                            LITTLE FAITHFUL.\
\
\
For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the\
neighborhood. It was really amazing, for every one seemed in a heavenly\
frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their\
first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their\
praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into the old ways.\
They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to\
grow easier; and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that\
Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.\
\
Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and\
was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't\
like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and\
after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa\
to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and\
art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went\
daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much\
time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the\
Washington despatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight\
relapses into idleness or grieving. All the little duties were\
faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were\
forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone\
a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears\
for father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the\
folds of a certain dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed\
her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up\
after a sober fit, but every one felt how sweet and helpful Beth was,\
and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small\
affairs.\
\
All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character; and,\
when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well, and\
deserved praise. So they did; but their mistake was in ceasing to do\
well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.\
\
"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels; you know mother told us not\
to forget them," said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.\
\
"I'm too tired to go this afternoon," replied Meg, rocking comfortably\
as she sewed.\
\
"Can't you, Jo?" asked Beth.\
\
"Too stormy for me with my cold."\
\
"I thought it was almost well."\
\
"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to\
go to the Hummels'," said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of\
her inconsistency.\
\
"Why don't you go yourself?" asked Meg.\
\
"I _have_ been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to\
do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it;\
but it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go."\
\
Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go to-morrow.\
\
"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth; the air\
will do you good," said Jo, adding apologetically, "I'd go, but I want\
to finish my writing."\
\
"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought may be some of you would go,"\
said Beth.\
\
"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us," suggested Meg.\
\
"Well, I'll rest a little and wait for her."\
\
So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the\
Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed: Amy did not come; Meg went to\
her room to try on a new dress; Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah\
was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her\
hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and\
went out into the chilly air, with a heavy head, and a grieved look in\
her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her\
creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour\
after Jo went to "mother's closet" for something, and there found Beth\
sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes, and a\
camphor-bottle in her hand.\
\
"Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?" cried Jo, as Beth put out her\
hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly,--\
\
"You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?"\
\
"Years ago, when Meg did. Why?"\
\
"Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"\
\
"What baby?"\
\
"Mrs. Hummel's; it died in my lap before she got home," cried Beth, with\
a sob.\
\
"My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone," said Jo,\
taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big chair,\
with a remorseful face.\
\
"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute that it was\
sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took\
baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden it gave a\
little cry, and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its\
feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was\
dead."\
\
         [Illustration: It didn't stir, and I knew it was dead]\
\
"Don't cry, dear! What did you do?"\
\
"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He\
said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have got sore\
throats. 'Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before,' he said\
crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby\
herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the\
others, and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was\
kinder; but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round,\
all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away,\
or I'd have the fever."\
\
"No, you won't!" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. "O\
Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What _shall_\
we do?"\
\
"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in\
mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and\
queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel\
better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead, and\
trying to look well.\
\
"If mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and\
feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a page, looked\
at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely;\
"You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the\
others who are going to have it; so I'm afraid _you_ are going to have\
it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness."\
\
"Don't let Amy come; she never had it, and I should hate to give it to\
her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth, anxiously.\
\
"I guess not; don't care if I do; serve me right, selfish pig, to let\
you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as she went to\
consult Hannah.\
\
The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,\
assuring Jo that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet\
fever, and, if rightly treated, nobody died,--all of which Jo believed,\
and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.\
\
"Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had examined\
and questioned Beth; "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at\
you, dear, and see that we start right; then we'll send Amy off to Aunt\
March's, for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you\
girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two."\
\
"I shall stay, of course; I'm oldest," began Meg, looking anxious and\
self-reproachful.\
\
"_I_ shall, because it's my fault she is sick; I told mother I'd do the\
errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.\
\
"Which will you have, Beth? there ain't no need of but one," said\
Hannah.\
\
"Jo, please;" and Beth leaned her head against her sister, with a\
contented look, which effectually settled that point.\
\
"I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather\
relieved, on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.\
\
Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather\
have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and\
commanded: all in vain. Amy protested that she would _not_ go; and Meg\
left her in despair, to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came\
back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head\
in the sofa-cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled; but\
Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,\
whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat\
down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, "Now be a\
sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what\
a jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take\
you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.\
Won't that be better than moping here?"\
\
                 [Illustration: He sat down beside her]\
\
"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy, in an\
injured voice.\
\
"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be\
sick, do you?"\
\
"No, I'm sure I don't; but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with\
Beth all the time."\
\
"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may\
escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say; or, if\
it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you\
to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss."\
\
"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy, looking\
rather frightened.\
\
"It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,\
and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as\
sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do."\
\
"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"\
\
"On my honor as a gentleman."\
\
"And come every single day?"\
\
"See if I don't."\
\
"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"\
\
"The identical minute."\
\
"And go to the theatre, truly?"\
\
"A dozen theatres, if we may."\
\
"Well--I guess--I will," said Amy slowly.\
\
"Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in," said Laurie, with an\
approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the "giving in."\
\
Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been\
wrought; and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised\
to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.\
\
"How is the little dear?" asked Laurie; for Beth was his especial pet,\
and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.\
\
"She is lying down on mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death\
troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah _says_ she\
thinks so; but she _looks_ worried, and that makes me fidgety," answered\
Meg.\
\
"What a trying world it is!" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful\
sort of way. "No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes\
another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when mother's\
gone; so I'm all at sea."\
\
"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle\
your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do\
anything?" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of\
his friend's one beauty.\
\
"That is what troubles me," said Meg. "I think we ought to tell her if\
Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for mother can't leave\
father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long, and\
Hannah knows just what to do, and mother said we were to mind her, so I\
suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me."\
\
"Hum, well, I can't say; suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor\
has been."\
\
"We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once," commanded Meg; "we can't\
decide anything till he has been."\
\
"Stay where you are, Jo; I'm errand-boy to this establishment," said\
Laurie, taking up his cap.\
\
"I'm afraid you are busy," began Meg.\
\
"No, I've done my lessons for the day."\
\
"Do you study in vacation time?" asked Jo.\
\
"I follow the good example my neighbors set me," was Laurie's answer, as\
he swung himself out of the room.\
\
"I have great hopes of my boy," observed Jo, watching him fly over the\
fence with an approving smile.\
\
"He does very well--for a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,\
for the subject did not interest her.\
\
Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but thought she\
would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy\
was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger,\
she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.\
\
Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.\
\
"What do you want now?" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,\
while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out,--\
\
                 [Illustration: What do you want now?]\
\
"Go away. No boys allowed here."\
\
Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.\
\
"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among\
poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,\
which I've no doubt she will be,--looks like it now. Don't cry, child,\
it worries me to hear people sniff."\
\
Amy _was_ on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's\
tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak, and call out,--\
\
"Bless my boots!" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.\
\
"What do you hear from your mother?" asked the old lady gruffly.\
\
"Father is much better," replied Jo, trying to keep sober.\
\
"Oh, is he? Well, that won't last long, I fancy; March never had any\
stamina," was the cheerful reply.\
\
"Ha, ha! never say die, take a pinch of snuff, good by, good by!"\
squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap\
as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.\
\
"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! and, Jo, you'd better go\
at once; it isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a rattle-pated\
boy like--"\
\
"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!" cried Polly, tumbling\
off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the "rattle-pated" boy,\
who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.\
\
"I don't think I _can_ bear it, but I'll try," thought Amy, as she was\
left alone with Aunt March.\
\
"Get along, you fright!" screamed Polly; and at that rude speech Amy\
could not restrain a sniff.\
\
\
\
\
                                 XVIII.\
\
                               DARK DAYS.\
\
\
                [Illustration: Beth did have the fever]\
\
Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than any one but Hannah and\
the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.\
Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her\
own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the\
excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,\
and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote\
letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not\
think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind\
Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of "Mrs. March bein' told, and worried\
just for sech a trifle." Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night; not a\
hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly\
as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during\
the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on\
the coverlet, as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a\
throat so swollen that there was no music left; a time when she did not\
know the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names,\
and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg\
begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she "would\
think of it, though there was no danger _yet_." A letter from Washington\
added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not\
think of coming home for a long while.\
\
How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how\
heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while\
the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that\
Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how\
rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could\
buy,--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of\
life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that\
suffering little sister always before her eyes, and that pathetic voice\
sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of\
Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all\
hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition, to\
live for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those simple\
virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more\
than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to\
be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service\
would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how\
many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie\
haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the\
grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young\
neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Every one\
missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she\
did; poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness, and to\
get a shroud for Minna; the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and\
good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how\
many friends shy little Beth had made.\
\
Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in\
her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn _prot\'e9g\'e9_. She longed for\
her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick;\
and, in her quiet hours, she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent\
loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write\
soon; and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that\
father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these\
intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing\
to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy\
sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,\
Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to\
send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.\
\
The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind\
blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death.\
When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot\
hand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low\
tone, to Hannah,--\
\
"If Mrs. March _can_ leave her husband, she'd better be sent for."\
\
Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously; Meg\
dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs\
at the sound of those words; and Jo, after standing with a pale face for\
a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and, throwing on\
her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and, while\
noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying\
that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy\
weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of\
misery that Laurie asked quickly,--\
\
"What is it? is Beth worse?"\
\
"I've sent for mother," said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a\
tragical expression.\
\
"Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?" asked\
Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair, and took off the rebellious\
boots, seeing how her hands shook.\
\
"No, the doctor told us to."\
\
"O Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a startled face.\
\
"Yes, it is; she doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the\
flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine-leaves on the wall; she\
doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it; mother\
and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find Him."\
\
As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her\
hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie\
took it in his, whispering, as well as he could, with a lump in his\
throat,--\
\
"I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"\
\
She could not speak, but she did "hold on," and the warm grasp of the\
friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her\
nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.\
Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting\
words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as\
her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done; far\
more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken\
sympathy, and, in the silence, learned the sweet solace which affection\
administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her,\
and looked up with a grateful face.\
\
   [Illustration: Gently stroking her head as her mother used to do]\
\
"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now; I don't feel so forlorn, and will try\
to bear it if it comes."\
\
"Keep hoping for the best; that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will\
be here, and then everything will be right."\
\
"I'm so glad father is better; now she won't feel so bad about leaving\
him. Oh, me! it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I\
got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo, spreading her wet\
handkerchief over her knees to dry.\
\
"Doesn't Meg pull fair?" asked Laurie, looking indignant.\
\
"Oh, yes; she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do; and she won't\
miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I _can't_ give her up. I\
can't! I can't!"\
\
Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried\
despairingly; for she had kept up bravely till now, and never shed a\
tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he\
had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It\
might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.\
Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I don't think she\
will die; she's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe\
God will take her away yet."\
\
"The good and dear people always do die," groaned Jo, but she stopped\
crying, for her friend's words cheered her up, in spite of her own\
doubts and fears.\
\
"Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a\
bit; I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."\
\
Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down\
on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the\
table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the\
submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo; and, when\
Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile,\
and said bravely, "I drink--Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor,\
Teddy, and _such_ a comfortable friend; how can I ever pay you?" she\
added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her\
troubled mind.\
\
"I'll send in my bill, by and by; and to-night I'll give you something\
that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,"\
said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at\
something.\
\
"What is it?" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute, in her wonder.\
\
"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come\
at once, and she'll be here to-night, and everything will be all right.\
Aren't you glad I did it?"\
\
Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for\
he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or\
harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment\
he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his\
neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, "O Laurie! O mother! I _am_ so\
glad!" She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled\
and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden\
news. Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of\
mind; he patted her back soothingly, and, finding that she was\
recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo\
round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away,\
saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't! I didn't mean to; it was dreadful of\
me; but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I\
couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me\
wine again; it makes me act so."\
\
"I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. "Why, you see I\
got fidgety, and so did grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the\
authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive\
us if Beth--well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to\
say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office\
yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off\
when I proposed a telegram. I never _can_ bear to be 'lorded over;' so\
that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and\
the late train is in at two, A.M. I shall go for her; and you've only\
got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet, till that blessed\
lady gets here."\
\
"Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?"\
\
"Fly at me again; I rather like it," said Laurie, looking\
mischievous,--a thing he had not done for a fortnight.\
\
"No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't\
tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless you,\
Teddy, bless you!"\
\
Jo had backed into a corner; and, as she finished her speech, she\
vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a\
dresser, and told the assembled cats that she was "happy, oh, _so_\
happy!" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made rather a neat\
thing of it.\
\
"That's the interferingest chap I ever see; but I forgive him, and do\
hope Mrs. March is coming on right away," said Hannah, with an air of\
relief, when Jo told the good news.\
\
Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set\
the sick-room in order, and Hannah "knocked up a couple of pies in case\
of company unexpected." A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the\
house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.\
Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change; Beth's bird began to\
chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the\
window; the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness; and every time\
the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one\
another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear! mother's\
coming!" Every one rejoiced but Beth; she lay in that heavy stupor,\
alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous\
sight,--the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so\
weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty,\
well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she\
lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips so\
parched they could hardly shape the word; all day Jo and Meg hovered\
over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and mother; and\
all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged\
slowly by. But night came at last; and every time the clock struck, the\
sisters, still sitting on either side the bed, looked at each other with\
brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been\
in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take\
place about midnight, at which time he would return.\
\
Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot, and fell\
fast asleep; Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that\
he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's anxious\
countenance as she entered; Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest,\
but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black\
eyes beautifully soft and clear.\
\
The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they\
kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes\
to us in hours like those.\
\
"If God spares Beth I never will complain again," whispered Meg\
earnestly.\
\
"If God spares Beth I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,"\
answered Jo, with equal fervor.\
\
"I wish I had no heart, it aches so," sighed Meg, after a pause.\
\
"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get\
through it," added her sister despondently.\
\
Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching\
Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was\
still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep\
hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale\
shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and\
nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.\
Another hour,--still no one came; and anxious fears of delay in the\
storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at\
Washington, haunted the poor girls.\
\
It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary\
the world looked in its winding-sheet of snow, heard a movement by the\
bed, and, turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's\
easy-chair, with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo,\
as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me."\
\
She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great\
change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain\
were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in\
its utter repose, that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning\
low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with\
her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, "Good-by, my Beth;\
good-by!"\
\
As if waked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the\
bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then,\
throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,\
exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's turned; she's sleepin'\
nat'ral; her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my\
goodness me!"\
\
Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to\
confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite\
heavenly when he smiled, and said, with a fatherly look at them, "Yes,\
my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the\
house quiet; let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her--"\
\
What they were to give, neither heard; for both crept into the dark\
hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with\
hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled\
by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her\
cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing\
quietly, as if just fallen asleep.\
\
"If mother would only come now!" said Jo, as the winter night began to\
wane.\
\
"See," said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, "I thought\
this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand to-morrow if she--went\
away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put\
it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she\
sees will be the little rose, and mother's face."\
\
Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed\
so lovely, as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out\
in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.\
\
"It looks like a fairy world," said Meg, smiling to herself, as she\
stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.\
\
"Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.\
\
Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,\
and then Laurie's voice saying, in a joyful whisper, "Girls, she's come!\
she's come!"\
\

                       [Illustration: Amy's Will]\
\
                                  XIX.\
\
                              AMY'S WILL.\
\
\
While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at\
Aunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her\
life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March\
never petted any one; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be\
kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt\
March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,\
though she didn't think proper to confess it. She really did her best to\
make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people\
keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize\
with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can\
hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship\
in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried\
Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy\
talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the\
old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the\
bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and\
taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,--a process\
which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the\
web of a very strict spider.\
\
     [Illustration: Polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot]\
\
She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned\
spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses, till they shone. Then\
she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck\
escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs, and much\
carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the\
lap-dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down, to get things, or\
deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame, and seldom left her big\
chair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a\
daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour\
for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie came every day,\
and wheedled Aunt March, till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when\
they walked and rode, and had capital times. After dinner, she had to\
read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually\
did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork\
or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward\
rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked\
till tea-time. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell\
to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull\
that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard\
fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a\
tear or two.\
\
If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that\
she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone\
was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not\
admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He\
pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to\
plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking\
at him while Madam dozed; called her names before company, and behaved\
in all respects like a reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure\
the dog,--a fat, cross beast, who snarled and yelped at her when she\
made his toilet, and who lay on his back, with all his legs in the air\
and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to\
eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the\
old coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of\
the young lady.\
\
       [Illustration: On his back, with all his legs in the air]\
\
Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with "Madame," as she called her\
mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,\
who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but\
Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that\
she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to\
Mademoiselle, and amused her very much, with odd stories of her life in\
France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. She also\
allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and\
pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests;\
for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian\
cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeon-holes, and secret places,\
in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely\
curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things\
gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel-cases, in which, on\
velvet cushions, reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty\
years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came\
out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding-day, her lover's\
diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with\
portraits of dead friends, and weeping willows made of hair inside; the\
baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn; Uncle March's big\
watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in\
a box, all by itself, lay Aunt March's wedding-ring, too small now for\
her fat finger, but put carefully away, like the most precious jewel of\
them all.\
\
                  [Illustration: I should choose this]\
\
"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?" asked Esther, who\
always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.\
\
"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm\
fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I\
might," replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold\
and ebony beads, from which hung a heavy cross of the same.\
\
"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! to me it is a\
rosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic," said Esther,\
eying the handsome thing wistfully.\
\
"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads\
hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.\
\
"Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one\
used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou."\
\
"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and\
always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could."\
\
"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but, as\
that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day, to\
meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame.\
She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble."\
\
"Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who, in her\
loneliness, felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was\
apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her\
of it.\
\
"It would be excellent and charming; and I shall gladly arrange the\
little dressing-room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but\
when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and\
pray the dear God to preserve your sister."\
\
Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice; for she had an\
affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy\
liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her\
room, hoping it would do her good.\
\
"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March\
dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary, and shut the\
jewel-cases one by one.\
\
"To you and your sisters. I know it; Madame confides in me; I witnessed\
her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther, smiling.\
\
"How nice! but I wish she'd let us have them now. Pro-cras-ti-nation is\
not agreeable," observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.\
\
"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first\
one who is affianced will have the pearls--Madame has said it; and I\
have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when\
you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners."\
\
"Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely\
ring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt\
March, after all;" and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face,\
and a firm resolve to earn it.\
\
From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady\
complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the\
closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a\
picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no\
great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that\
Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very\
valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's\
beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of\
the divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her\
heart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymn-book, kept a\
vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every\
day to "sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to\
preserve her sister." Esther had given her a rosary of black beads, with\
a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful\
as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.\
\
The little girl was very sincere in all this, for, being left alone\
outside the safe home-nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold\
by so sorely, that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender\
Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children.\
She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having\
been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way, and walk in\
it confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden\
seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be\
satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In\
her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,\
as Aunt March had done; so that if she _did_ fall ill and die, her\
possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang\
even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were\
as precious as the old lady's jewels.\
\
During one of her play-hours she wrote out the important document as\
well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms,\
and, when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt\
relieved, and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second\
witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in\
one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this\
room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes, with which\
Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array\
herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long\
mirror, making stately courtesies, and sweeping her train about, with a\
rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she\
did not hear Laurie's ring, nor see his face peeping in at her, as she\
gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on\
which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue\
brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk\
carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo\
afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay\
suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as\
well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, "Ain't\
we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha!\
ha!"\
\
             [Illustration: Gravely promenaded to and fro]\
\
Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it\
should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped, and was graciously received.\
\
"Sit down and rest while I put these things away; then I want to consult\
you about a very serious matter," said Amy, when she had shown her\
splendor, and driven Polly into a corner. "That bird is the trial of my\
life," she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while\
Laurie seated himself astride of a chair. "Yesterday, when aunt was\
asleep, and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to\
squall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a\
big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly\
marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase,\
saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, 'Come out and take a\
walk, my dear.' I _couldn't_ help laughing, which made Poll swear, and\
aunt woke up and scolded us both."\
\
"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?" asked Laurie,\
yawning.\
\
"Yes; out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and\
scrambled up on aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! catch her! catch\
her!' as I chased the spider.\
\
"That's a lie! Oh lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.\
\
"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried Laurie,\
shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side, and gravely\
croaked, "Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!"\
\
"Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe, and taking a paper out\
of her pocket. "I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is\
legal and right. I felt that I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and\
I don't want any ill-feeling over my tomb."\
\
                       [Illustration: Amy's Will]\
\
Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read\
the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the\
spelling:--\
\
    "MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.\
\
    "I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and\
    bequeethe all my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely\
\
    "To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of\
    art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.\
\
    "To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with\
    pockets,--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.\
\
    "To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get\
    it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of\
    real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of\
    her 'little girl.'\
\
    "To Jo I leave my breast-pin, the one mended with sealing wax,\
    also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most\
    precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burnt up her\
    story.\
\
    "To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little\
    bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can\
    wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also\
    leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.\
\
    "To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my\
    paper marshay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did\
    say it hadn't any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in\
    the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes,\
    Noter Dame is the best.\
\
    "To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box\
    with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his\
    pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his\
    favors to her family, specially Beth.\
\
    "I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk\
    apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.\
\
    "To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patch work\
    I leave hoping she 'will remember me, when it you see.'\
\
    "And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all\
    will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive every one,\
    and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.\
\
    "To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th\
    day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.\
                                                  "AMY CURTIS MARCH.\
\
                  \{ESTELLE VALNOR,\
    "_Witnesses_: \{\
                  \{THEODORE LAURENCE."\
\
The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to\
rewrite it in ink, and seal it up for her properly.\
\
"What put it into your head? Did any one tell you about Beth's giving\
away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,\
with sealing-wax, a taper, and a standish before him.\
\
She explained; and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"\
\
"I'm sorry I spoke; but as I did, I'll tell you. She felt so ill one day\
that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you,\
and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was\
sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of\
us, and her best love to grandpa. _She_ never thought of a will."\
\
Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a\
great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of trouble; but she\
only said, "Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,\
sometimes?"\
\
"Yes; 'codicils,' they call them."\
\
"Put one in mine then--that I wish _all_ my curls cut off, and given\
round to my friends. I forgot it; but I want it done, though it will\
spoil my looks."\
\
Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he\
amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But\
when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper, with trembling lips,\
"Is there really any danger about Beth?"\
\
"I'm afraid there is; but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,\
dear;" and Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which\
was very comforting.\
\
When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and, sitting in the\
twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,\
feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the\
loss of her gentle little sister.\

\
\
I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the\
mother and daughters; such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to\
describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely\
saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's\
tender hope was realized; for when Beth woke from that long, healing\
sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell _were_ the little rose\
and mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled, and\
nestled close into the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry\
longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls\
waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which\
clung to hers even in sleep. Hannah had "dished up" an astonishing\
breakfast for the traveller, finding it impossible to vent her\
excitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like\
dutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of\
father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays\
which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable\
comfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out\
with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.\
\
What a strange, yet pleasant day that was! so brilliant and gay without,\
for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow; so quiet and\
reposeful within, for every one slept, spent with watching, and a\
Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah\
mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off,\
Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten\
boats, safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave\
Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at,\
touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered\
treasure.\
\
Laurie, meanwhile, posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well\
that Aunt March actually "sniffed" herself, and never once said, "I told\
you so." Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good\
thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her\
tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never\
even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in\
Laurie's opinion, that she behaved "like a capital little woman." Even\
Polly seemed impressed, for he called her "good girl," blessed her\
buttons, and begged her to "come and take a walk, dear," in his most\
affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright\
wintry weather; but, discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in\
spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest\
on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time\
about it; and, when she returned, he was stretched out, with both arms\
under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the\
curtains, and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.\
\
After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night,\
and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by\
Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good\
many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my\
private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her\
mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation\
in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone\
together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its\
purpose was explained to her.\
\
"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," looking from the dusty\
rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its\
garland of evergreen. "It is an excellent plan to have some place where\
we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good\
many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we\
ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this?"\
\
"Yes, mother; and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big\
closet to put my books, and the copy of that picture which I've tried to\
make. The woman's face is not good,--it's too beautiful for me to\
draw,--but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to\
think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and\
that helps me."\
\
As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ-child on his mother's knee, Mrs.\
March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said\
nothing, but Amy understood the look, and, after a minute's pause, she\
added gravely,--\
\
"I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the\
ring to-day; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my\
finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me\
always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too\
big. I'd like to wear them, mother; can I?"\
\
"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such\
ornaments, Amy," said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with\
the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard,\
formed of two tiny, golden hands clasped together.\
\
"I'll try not to be vain," said Amy. "I don't think I like it only\
because it's so pretty; but I want to wear it as the girl in the story\
wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."\
\
"Do you mean Aunt March?" asked her mother, laughing.\
\
"No, to remind me not to be selfish." Amy looked so earnest and sincere\
about it, that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to\
the little plan.\
\
"I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties,' and\
being selfish is the largest one in it; so I'm going to try hard to cure\
it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason every one loves\
her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel\
half so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them;\
but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm\
going to try and be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my\
resolutions; but if I had something always about me to remind me, I\
guess I should do better. May I try this way?"\
\
"Yes; but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your\
ring, dear, and do your best; I think you will prosper, for the sincere\
wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up\
your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again."\
\
That evening, while Meg was writing to her father, to report the\
traveller's safe arrival, Jo slipped up stairs into Beth's room, and,\
finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her\
fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.\
\
"What is it, deary?" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face\
which invited confidence.\
\
"I want to tell you something, mother."\
\
"About Meg?"\
\
"How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a little\
thing, it fidgets me."\
\
"Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn't\
been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.\
\
"No, I should have shut the door in his face if he had," said Jo,\
settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. "Last summer Meg\
left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences', and only one was returned.\
We forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it. He\
kept it in his waistcoat pocket, and once it fell out, and Teddy joked\
him about it, and Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg, but didn't dare\
say so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn't it a _dread_ful\
state of things?"\
\
"Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious\
look.\
\
"Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!" cried\
Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. "In novels, the girls\
show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and\
acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort: she eats\
and drinks and sleeps, like a sensible creature: she looks straight in\
my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when\
Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me\
as he ought."\
\
"Then you fancy that Meg is _not_ interested in John?"\
\
"Who?" cried Jo, staring.\
\
"Mr. Brooke. I call him 'John' now; we fell into the way of doing so at\
the hospital, and he likes it."\
\
"Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part: he's been good to father, and\
you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean\
thing! to go petting papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into\
liking him;" and Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.\
\
"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened.\
John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor\
father that we couldn't help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open\
and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a\
comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our\
leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him\
if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse\
to listen to him; but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so\
young."\
\
"Of course not; it would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing;\
I felt it; and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry\
Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."\
\
This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile; but she said gravely, "Jo, I\
confide in you, and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John\
comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings\
toward him."\
\
"She'll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then\
it will be all up with her. She's got such a soft heart, it will melt\
like butter in the sun if any one looks sentimentally at her. She read\
the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me\
when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly\
name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and\
fun, and cosy times together. I see it all! they'll go lovering around\
the house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good\
to me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,\
and make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and\
everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! why weren't we\
all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."\
\
Jo leaned her chin on her knees, in a disconsolate attitude, and shook\
her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up\
with an air of relief.\
\
"You don't like it, mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about his\
business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we\
always have been."\
\
"I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to\
homes of your own, in time; but I do want to keep my girls as long as I\
can; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only\
seventeen, and it will be some years before John can make a home for\
her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in\
any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one\
another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is\
conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My\
pretty, tender-hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her."\
\
"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked Jo, as her mother's\
voice faltered a little over the last words.\
\
"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo; and I hope my girls will never\
feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should\
like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,\
which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make\
Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable\
position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with\
love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your\
good fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can\
be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and\
some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see\
Meg begin humbly, for, if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the\
possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune."\
\
"I understand, mother, and quite agree; but I'm disappointed about Meg,\
for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by and by, and sit in the lap of\
luxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice?" asked Jo, looking up, with a\
brighter face.\
\
"He is younger than she, you know," began Mrs. March; but Jo broke in,--\
\
"Only a little; he's old for his age, and tall; and can be quite\
grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous and\
good, and loves us all; and _I_ say it's a pity my plan is spoilt."\
\
"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg, and altogether too\
much of a weathercock, just now, for any one to depend on. Don't make\
plans, Jo; but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can't\
meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic\
rubbish,' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship."\
\
"Well, I won't; but I hate to see things going all criss-cross and\
getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten\
it out. I wish wearing flat-irons on our heads would keep us from\
growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens, cats,--more's the\
pity!"\
\
"What's that about flat-irons and cats?" asked Meg, as she crept into\
the room, with the finished letter in her hand.\
\
"Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed; come, Peggy," said\
Jo, unfolding herself, like an animated puzzle.\
\
"Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to\
John," said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter, and gave it\
back.\
\
"Do you call him 'John'?" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes\
looking down into her mother's.\
\
"Yes; he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,"\
replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.\
\
"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good-night, mother, dear. It is so\
inexpressibly comfortable to have you here," was Meg's quiet answer.\
\
The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one; and, as she went\
away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, "She\
does not love John yet, but will soon learn to."\

\
               LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE.\
\
\
Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,\
and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed\
it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned\
that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt\
sure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather\
surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed\
a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in her turn\
assumed an air of dignified reserve, and devoted herself to her mother.\
This left Jo to her own devices; for Mrs. March had taken her place as\
nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long\
confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge; and, much as\
she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an\
incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax her secret from her.\
\
She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a\
mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of\
it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected\
indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he\
knew, then that he didn't care; and, at last, by dint of perseverance,\
he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling\
indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his\
wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.\
\
Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter, and was absorbed in\
preparations for her father's return; but all of a sudden a change\
seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike\
herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very\
quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face.\
To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's\
she silenced by begging to be let alone.\
\
"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast. She's\
got most of the symptoms,--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat, lies\
awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her,\
and once she said 'John,' as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy.\
Whatever shall we do?" said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however\
violent.\
\
"Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and father's\
coming will settle everything," replied her mother.\
\
"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals\
mine," said Jo, next day, as she distributed the contents of the little\
post-office.\
\
Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg\
made them look up to see her staring at her note, with a frightened\
face.\
\
"My child, what is it?" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried\
to take the paper which had done the mischief.\
\
"It's all a mistake--he didn't send it. O Jo, how could you do it?" and\
Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart was quite broken.\
\
"Me! I've done nothing! What's she talking about?" cried Jo, bewildered.\
\
Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from\
her pocket, and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,--\
\
"You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so\
mean, and cruel to us both?"\
\
Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which\
was written in a peculiar hand.\
\
        [Illustration: Jo and her mother were reading the note]\
\
    "MY DEAREST MARGARET,--\
\
    "I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate\
    before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think\
    they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr.\
    Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet\
    girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to\
    your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to\
                                            "Your devoted JOHN."\
\
"Oh, the little villain! that's the way he meant to pay me for keeping\
my word to mother. I'll give him a hearty scolding, and bring him over\
to beg pardon," cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her\
mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore,--\
\
"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many\
pranks, that I am afraid you have had a hand in this."\
\
"On my word, mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, and don't\
know anything about it, as true as I live!" said Jo, so earnestly that\
they believed her. "If I _had_ taken a part in it I'd have done it\
better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you'd\
have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that," she added,\
scornfully tossing down the paper.\
\
"It's like his writing," faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her\
hand.\
\
"O Meg, you didn't answer it?" cried Mrs. March quickly.\
\
"Yes, I did!" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.\
\
"Here's a scrape! _Do_ let me bring that wicked boy over to explain, and\
be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him;" and Jo made for the\
door again.\
\
"Hush! let me manage this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,\
tell me the whole story," commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet\
keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.\
\
"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew\
anything about it," began Meg, without looking up. "I was worried at\
first, and meant to tell you; then I remembered how you liked Mr.\
Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a\
few days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew; and, while I\
was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such\
things to do. Forgive me, mother, I'm paid for my silliness now; I never\
can look him in the face again."\
\
"What did you say to him?" asked Mrs. March.\
\
"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet; that I didn't\
wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very\
grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,\
for a long while."\
\
Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,\
exclaiming, with a laugh,--\
\
"You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!\
Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?"\
\
"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent\
any love-letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,\
should take such liberties with our names. It's very kind and\
respectful, but think how dreadful for me!"\
\
Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo\
tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she\
stopped, caught up the two notes, and, after looking at them closely,\
said decidedly, "I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these\
letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with, because\
I wouldn't tell him my secret."\
\
"Don't have any secrets, Jo; tell it to mother, and keep out of trouble,\
as I should have done," said Meg warningly.\
\
"Bless you, child! Mother told me."\
\
"That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall\
sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once."\
\
Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.\
"Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he\
can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the\
present?"\
\
"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do\
with lovers for a long while,--perhaps never," answered Meg petulantly.\
"If John _doesn't_ know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him,\
and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and\
plagued and made a fool of,--it's a shame!"\
\
Seeing that Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by\
this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire\
silence, and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step\
was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received\
the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he\
wouldn't come; but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and\
stood twirling his hat, with a guilty air which convicted him at once.\
Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a\
sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of\
voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour; but what happened\
during that interview the girls never knew.\
\
When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother, with such\
a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it\
wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much\
comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.\
\
"I'll never tell him to my dying day,--wild horses sha'n't drag it out\
of me; so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how\
out-and-out sorry I am," he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.\
\
"I'll try; but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn't think\
you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied Meg, trying to hide\
her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.\
\
"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for a\
month; but you will, though, won't you?" and Laurie folded his hands\
together with such an imploring gesture, as he spoke in his irresistibly\
persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him, in spite of\
his scandalous behavior. Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face\
relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him\
declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and\
abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.\
\
Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and\
succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire\
disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but, as she showed\
no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till\
the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow, and walked\
off without a word.\
\
As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving; and when\
Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely, and longed for Teddy.\
After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and, armed\
with a book to return, went over to the big house.\
\
"Is Mr. Laurence in?" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming down\
stairs.\
\
"Yes, miss; but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."\
\
"Why not? is he ill?"\
\
"La, no, miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of\
his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I\
dursn't go nigh him."\
\
"Where is Laurie?"\
\
"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I\
don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's\
no one to eat it."\
\
"I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them."\
\
Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.\
\
"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!" called out the young\
gentleman, in a threatening tone.\
\
Jo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced,\
before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really\
_was_ out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite\
expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,\
"Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't\
go away till I have."\
\
"It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo," was the cavalier\
reply to her petition.\
\
              [Illustration: Get up and don't be a goose]\
\
"Thank you; I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't look\
exactly easy in your mind."\
\
"I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!" growled Laurie indignantly.\
\
"Who did it?" demanded Jo.\
\
"Grandfather; if it had been any one else I'd have--" and the injured\
youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.\
\
"That's nothing; I often shake you, and you don't mind," said Jo\
soothingly.\
\
"Pooh! you're a girl, and it's fun; but I'll allow no man to shake\
_me_."\
\
"I don't think any one would care to try it, if you looked as much like\
a thunder-cloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?"\
\
"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd\
promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word."\
\
"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"\
\
"No; he _would_ have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\
truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing\
Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the\
old gentleman collared me. Then I got angry, and bolted, for fear I\
should forget myself."\
\
"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know; so go down and make up. I'll\
help you."\
\
"Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by every\
one, just for a bit of a frolic. I _was_ sorry about Meg, and begged\
pardon like a man; but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the wrong."\
\
"He didn't know that."\
\
"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no use, Jo;\
he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't need\
any one's apron-string to hold on by."\
\
"What pepper-pots you are!" sighed Jo. "How do you mean to settle this\
affair?"\
\
"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell\
him what the fuss's about."\
\
"Bless you! he won't do that."\
\
"I won't go down till he does."\
\
"Now, Teddy, be sensible; let it pass, and I'll explain what I can. You\
can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?"\
\
"I don't intend to stay here long, any way. I'll slip off and take a\
journey somewhere, and when grandpa misses me he'll come round fast\
enough."\
\
"I dare say; but you ought not to go and worry him."\
\
"Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke; it's gay there, and\
I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."\
\
"What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too," said Jo, forgetting\
her part of Mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.\
\
"Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I'll stir\
up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke; let's do it, Jo. We'll leave\
a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I've got money\
enough; it will do you good, and be no harm, as you go to your father."\
\
For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree; for, wild as the plan was,\
it just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for\
change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel\
charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they\
turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house\
opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.\
\
"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time; but as\
I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper, and stop at home. Don't tempt\
me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."\
\
"That's the fun of it," began Laurie, who had got a wilful fit on him,\
and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.\
\
"Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears. "'Prunes and prisms'\
are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to\
moralize, not to hear about things that make me skip to think of."\
\
    [Illustration: "Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears]\
\
"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had\
more spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.\
\
"Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go making\
me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will\
you give up running away?" asked Jo seriously.\
\
"Yes, but you won't do it," answered Laurie, who wished "to make up,"\
but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.\
\
"If I can manage the young one I can the old one," muttered Jo, as she\
walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map, with his head\
propped up on both hands.\
\
"Come in!" and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as\
Jo tapped at his door.\
\
"It's only me, sir, come to return a book," she said blandly, as she\
entered.\
\
"Want any more?" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but\
trying not to show it.\
\
"Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second\
volume," returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second\
dose of Boswell's "Johnson," as he had recommended that lively work.\
\
The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little, as he rolled the steps toward the\
shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and,\
sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was\
really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her\
visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her\
mind; for, after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced\
round on her, speaking so abruptly that "Rasselas" tumbled face downward\
on the floor.\
\
"What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know he has\
been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can't get a\
word from him; and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he\
bolted upstairs, and locked himself into his room."\
\
"He did do wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word\
to any one," began Jo reluctantly.\
\
"That won't do; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you\
soft-hearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg\
pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo, I won't be kept in the dark."\
\
Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have\
gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,\
and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and\
brave it out.\
\
     [Illustration: He stood at the foot, like a lion in the path]\
\
"Indeed, sir, I cannot tell; mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed,\
asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't keep silence to\
shield him, but some one else, and it will make more trouble if you\
interfere. Please don't; it was partly my fault, but it's all right now;\
so let's forget it, and talk about the 'Rambler,' or something\
pleasant."\
\
"Hang the 'Rambler!' come down and give me your word that this\
harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or impertinent.\
If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash him with my own\
hands."\
\
The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the\
irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,\
whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and\
made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or\
forgetting the truth.\
\
"Hum--ha--well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not\
from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow, and hard to\
manage," said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he\
had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an\
air of relief.\
\
"So am I; but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and\
all the king's men couldn't," said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her\
friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.\
\
"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?" was the sharp answer.\
\
"Oh, dear, no, sir; you are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a\
trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think you are?"\
\
Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,\
though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief\
and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles on to the\
table with a rattle, and exclaimed frankly,--\
\
"You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past\
bearing, and I don't know how it will end, if we go on so."\
\
"I'll tell you, he'll run away." Jo was sorry for that speech the\
minute it was made; she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear\
much restraint, and hoped he would be more forbearing with the lad.\
\
Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a\
troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his\
table. It was Laurie's father, who _had_ run away in his youth, and\
married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered\
and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.\
\
"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it\
sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like\
to, especially since my hair was cut; so, if you ever miss us, you may\
advertise for two boys, and look among the ships bound for India."\
\
She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently\
taking the whole as a joke.\
\
"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect for me,\
and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments\
they are; yet we can't do without them," he said, pinching her cheeks\
good-humoredly. "Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's\
all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his\
grandfather. I won't bear it."\
\
"He won't come, sir; he feels badly because you didn't believe him when\
he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very\
much."\
\
Jo tried to look pathetic, but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began\
to laugh, and she knew the day was won.\
\
"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking _me_, I\
suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?" and the old gentleman\
looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.\
\
"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, sir. He says he won't come\
down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an\
absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and\
bring him down quite amiable. Try it; he likes fun, and this way is\
better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty."\
\
Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying\
slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and\
Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this\
nonsense."\
\
The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to\
another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of\
Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie's\
door, advising him, through the key-hole, to be submissive, decorous,\
and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked\
again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away,\
when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at\
the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance,\
"What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added,\
laughing.\
\
"No; he was pretty mild, on the whole."\
\
"Ah! I got it all round; even you cast me off over there, and I felt\
just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.\
\
"Don't talk in that way; turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my\
son."\
\
"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil\
my copy-books; and I make so many beginnings there never will be an\
end," he said dolefully.\
\
"Go and eat your dinner; you'll feel better after it. Men always croak\
when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.\
\
"That's a 'label' on my 'sect,'" answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he\
went to partake of humble-pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was\
quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the\
rest of the day.\
\
Every one thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over; but\
the mischief was done, for, though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She\
never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal,\
dreamed dreams more than ever; and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk\
for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, "Mrs.\
John Brooke;" whereat she groaned tragically, and cast it into the fire,\
feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.\
\
\
\
\
  [Illustration: Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day]\
\

\
                           PLEASANT MEADOWS.\
\
\
Like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The\
invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning\
early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all\
day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats, at first, and, in time,\
with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behindhand. Her once active\
limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the\
house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white\
hands cooking delicate messes for "the dear;" while Amy, a loyal slave\
of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her\
treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.\
\
As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,\
and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible\
or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry\
Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had\
bonfires, sky-rockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.\
After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered\
effectually quenched, and went about with forlorn faces, which were\
rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.\
\
Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid\
Christmas Day. Hannah "felt in her bones" that it was going to be an\
unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for\
everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To\
begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them; then Beth\
felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's\
gift,--a soft crimson merino wrapper,--was borne in triumph to the\
window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had\
done their best to be worthy of the name, for, like elves, they had\
worked by night, and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden\
stood a stately snow-maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of\
fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in the other, a\
perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas\
carol issuing from her lips, on a pink paper streamer:--\
\
                         "THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH.\
\
        "God bless you, dear Queen Bess!\
          May nothing you dismay,\
         But health and peace and happiness\
          Be yours, this Christmas Day.\
\
        "Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,\
          And flowers for her nose;\
         Here's music for her pianee,\
          An Afghan for her toes.\
\
        "A portrait of Joanna, see,\
          By Raphael No. 2,\
         Who labored with great industry\
          To make it fair and true.\
\
        "Accept a ribbon red, I beg,\
          For Madam Purrer's tail;\
         And ice-cream made by lovely Peg,--\
          A Mont Blanc in a pail.\
\
        "Their dearest love my makers laid\
          Within my breast of snow:\
         Accept it, and the Alpine maid,\
          From Laurie and from Jo."\
\
                      [Illustration: The Jungfrau]\
\
How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in\
the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them!\
\
"I'm so full of happiness, that, if father was only here, I couldn't\
hold one drop more," said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo\
carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to\
refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the "Jungfrau" had\
sent her.\
\
"So am I," added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the\
long-desired Undine and Sintram.\
\
"I'm sure I am," echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the\
Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her, in a pretty frame.\
\
"Of course I am!" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first\
silk dress; for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.\
\
"How can _I_ be otherwise?" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went\
from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed\
the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which\
the girls had just fastened on her breast.\
\
Now and then, in this work-a-day world, things do happen in the\
delightful story-book fashion, and what a comfort that is. Half an hour\
after every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one\
drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door, and popped his\
head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and\
uttered an Indian war-whoop; for his face was so full of suppressed\
excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful, that every one jumped\
up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, "Here's another\
Christmas present for the March family."\
\
Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away\
somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,\
leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and\
couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede; and for several\
minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things\
were done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the\
embrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly\
fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china-closet; Mr.\
Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently\
explained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never\
stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most\
touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held\
up her hand with a warning, "Hush! remember Beth!"\
\
But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper\
appeared on the threshold,--joy put strength into the feeble limbs,--and\
Beth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just\
after that; for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness\
of the past, and leaving only the sweetness of the present.\
\
It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight\
again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat\
turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the\
kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for\
his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly\
remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he\
precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,\
which they did, by both sitting in one big chair, and talking hard.\
\
Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the\
fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage\
of it; how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most\
estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just\
there, and, after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,\
looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you\
to imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head, and asked,\
rather abruptly, if he wouldn't have something to eat. Jo saw and\
understood the look; and she stalked grimly away to get wine and\
beef-tea, muttering to herself, as she slammed the door, "I hate\
estimable young men with brown eyes!"\
\
There never _was_ such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat\
turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned,\
and decorated; so was the plum-pudding, which quite melted in one's\
mouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy revelled like a fly in a\
honey-pot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,\
"For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't\
roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'\
of it in a cloth."\
\
Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,--at whom\
Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy-chairs\
stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her\
father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank\
healths, told stories, sung songs, "reminisced," as the old folks say,\
and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh-ride had been planned, but the\
girls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and,\
as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.\
\
"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected\
to have. Do you remember?" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had\
followed a long conversation about many things.\
\
"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!" said Meg, smiling at the fire,\
and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.\
\
"I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy, watching the light\
shine on her ring, with thoughtful eyes.\
\
"I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered Beth, who\
sat on her father's knee.\
\
"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially\
the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely; and I think the\
burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon," said Mr. March,\
looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered\
round him.\
\
"How do you know? Did mother tell you?" asked Jo.\
\
"Not much; straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several\
discoveries to-day."\
\
"Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg, who sat beside him.\
\
"Here is one;" and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair,\
he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or\
three little hard spots on the palm. "I remember a time when this hand\
was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very\
pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now,--for in these seeming\
blemishes I read a little history. A burnt-offering has been made of\
vanity; this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters;\
and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long\
time, so much good-will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value\
the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or\
fashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious\
little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away."\
\
If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it\
in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he\
gave her.\
\
"What about Jo? Please say something nice; for she has tried so hard,\
and been so very, very good to me," said Beth, in her father's ear.\
\
He laughed, and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an\
unusually mild expression in her brown face.\
\
"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year\
ago," said Mr. March. "I see a young lady who pins her collar straight,\
laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on\
the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale, just now,\
with watching and anxiety; but I like to look at it, for it has grown\
gentler, and her voice is lower; she doesn't bounce, but moves quietly,\
and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which\
delights me. I rather miss my wild girl; but if I get a strong, helpful,\
tender-hearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't\
know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in\
all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought\
with the five-and-twenty dollars which my good girl sent me."\
\
Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy\
in the firelight, as she received her father's praise, feeling that she\
did deserve a portion of it.\
\
"Now Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.\
\
"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will\
slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be," began\
their father cheerfully; but recollecting how nearly he _had_ lost her,\
he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,\
"I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God."\
\
After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket\
at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair,--\
\
"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her\
mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place to-night, and has waited\
on every one with patience and good-humor. I also observe that she does\
not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very\
pretty ring which she wears; so I conclude that she has learned to think\
of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and\
mould her character as carefully as she moulds her little clay figures.\
I am glad of this; for though I should be very proud of a graceful\
statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter,\
with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."\
\
"What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her\
father and told about her ring.\
\
"I read in 'Pilgrim's Progress' to-day, how, after many troubles,\
Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow, where lilies\
bloomed all the year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,\
before they went on to their journey's end," answered Beth; adding, as\
she slipped out of her father's arms, and went slowly to the instrument,\
"It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to\
sing the song of the shepherd-boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the\
music for father, because he likes the verses."\
\
So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and,\
in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sung to her own\
accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for\
her:--\
\
        "He that is down need fear no fall,\

        "Fulness to them a burden is,\

\
                    AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION.\
\
\
            [Illustration: Popping in her head now and then]\
\
Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about\
Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and\
listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by\
kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the\
other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then, "to\
peek at the dear man," nothing seemed needed to complete their\
happiness. But something _was_ needed, and the elder ones felt it,\
though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another\
with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden\
fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's\
umbrella, which had been left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy,\
and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was\
mentioned; Amy said "Every one seemed waiting for something, and\
couldn't settle down, which was queer, since father was safe at home,"\
and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as\
usual.\
\
 [Illustration: "He sat in the big chair by Beth's sofa with the other\
                      three close by."--Page 277.]\
\
Laurie went by in the afternoon, and, seeing Meg at the window, seemed\
suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down upon one\
knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands\
imploringly, as if begging some boon; and when Meg told him to behave\
himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,\
and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.\
\
"What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing, and trying to look\
unconscious.\
\
"He's showing you how your John will go on by and by. Touching, isn't\
it?" answered Jo scornfully.\
\
"Don't say _my John_, it isn't proper or true;" but Meg's voice lingered\
over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please don't plague\
me, Jo; I've told you I don't care _much_ about him, and there isn't to\
be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before."\
\
"We can't, for something _has_ been said, and Laurie's mischief has\
spoilt you for me. I see it, and so does mother; you are not like your\
old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to\
plague you, and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all\
settled. I hate to wait; so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and\
have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.\
\
"_I_ can't say or do anything till he speaks, and he won't, because\
father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work, with a\
queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with\
her father on that point.\
\
"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,\
or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No."\
\
"I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say,\
for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no\
knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared."\
\
Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had\
unconsciously assumed, and which was as becoming as the pretty color\
varying in her cheeks.\
\
"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more respectfully.\
\
"Not at all; you are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,\
and my experience will be useful to you by and by, perhaps, in your own\
affairs of this sort."\
\
"Don't mean to have any; it's fun to watch other people philander, but I\
should feel like a fool doing it myself," said Jo, looking alarmed at\
the thought.\
\
"I think not, if you liked any one very much, and he liked you." Meg\
spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane, where she had often\
seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.\
\
"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man," said Jo,\
rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.\
\
"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.\
Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with father that I am too young\
to enter into any engagement at present; so please say no more, but let\
us be friends as we were.'"\
\
"Hum! that's stiff and cool enough. I don't believe you'll ever say it,\
and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the\
rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his\
feelings."\
\
"No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out\
of the room with dignity."\
\
Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified\
exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat, and begin to\
sew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given\
time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and, when some one gave\
a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect, which was anything but\
hospitable.\
\
"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella,--that is, to see how your\
father finds himself to-day," said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused\
as his eye went from one tell-tale face to the other.\
\
"It's very well, he's in the rack, I'll get him, and tell it you are\
here," and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in\
her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her\
speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to\
sidle towards the door, murmuring,--\
\
"Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her."\
\
"Don't go; are you afraid of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke looked so\
hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She\
blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called\
her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet\
it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her\
ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said\
gratefully,--\
\
"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to father? I only wish I\
could thank you for it."\
\
                 [Illustration: Shall I tell you how?]\
\
"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in\
both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown\
eyes, that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away\
and to stop and listen.\
\
"Oh no, please don't--I'd rather not," she said, trying to withdraw her\
hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.\
\
"I won't trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little,\
Meg. I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke tenderly.\
\
This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it;\
she forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, "I don't\
know," so softly, that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish\
little reply.\
\
He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as\
if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said, in his\
most persuasive tone, "Will you try and find out? I want to know _so_\
much; for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am\
to have my reward in the end or not."\
\
"I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet\
rather enjoying it.\
\
"I'll wait; and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would\
it be a very hard lesson, dear?"\
\
"Not if I chose to learn it, but--"\
\
"Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than\
German," broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that\
she had no way of hiding her face, as he bent to look into it.\
\
His tone was properly beseeching; but, stealing a shy look at him, Meg\
saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the\
satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled\
her; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and\
the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little\
women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt\
excited and strange, and, not knowing what else to do, followed a\
capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, "I\
_don't_ choose. Please go away and let me be!"\
\
Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling\
about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it\
rather bewildered him.\
\
"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following her as she\
walked away.\
\
"Yes, I do; I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I\
needn't; it's too soon and I'd rather not."\
\
"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by and by? I'll wait, and say\
nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't\
think that of you."\
\
"Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't," said Meg, taking a\
naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.\
\
He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel\
heroes whom she admired; but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped\
about the room, as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully,\
so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her. What\
would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come\
hobbling in at this interesting minute.\
\
The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew; for she had\
met Laurie as she took her airing, and, hearing of Mr. March's arrival,\
drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part\
of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise\
them. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she\
had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.\
\
"Bless me, what's all this?" cried the old lady, with a rap of her cane,\
as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.\
\
               [Illustration: Bless me, what's all this?]\
\
"It's father's friend. I'm _so_ surprised to see you!" stammered Meg,\
feeling that she was in for a lecture now.\
\
"That's evident," returned Aunt March, sitting down. "But what is\
father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief\
going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is," with another rap.\
\
"We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella," began Meg,\
wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.\
\
"Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo\
blundered into a wrong message in one of your father's letters, and I\
made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, child?" cried Aunt\
March, looking scandalized.\
\
"Hush! he'll hear. Sha'n't I call mother?" said Meg, much troubled.\
\
"Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once.\
Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my\
money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl," said the\
old lady impressively.\
\
Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of\
opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us\
have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in\
love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would\
probably have declared she couldn't think of it; but as she was\
peremptorily ordered _not_ to like him, she immediately made up her mind\
that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision\
easy, and, being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with\
unusual spirit.\
\
"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money\
to any one you like," she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.\
\
"Highty tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, miss? You'll be\
sorry for it, by and by, when you've tried love in a cottage, and found\
it a failure."\
\
"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses," retorted\
Meg.\
\
Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did\
not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so\
brave and independent,--so glad to defend John, and assert her right to\
love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and,\
after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying, as mildly as she\
could, "Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable, and take my advice. I mean it\
kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake\
at the beginning. You ought to marry well, and help your family; it's\
your duty to make a rich match, and it ought to be impressed upon you."\
\
"Father and mother don't think so; they like John, though he _is_ poor."\
\
"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than two babies."\
\
"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.\
\
Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. "This Rook is\
poor, and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"\
\
"No; but he has many warm friends."\
\
"You can't live on friends; try it, and see how cool they'll grow. He\
hasn't any business, has he?"\
\
"Not yet; Mr. Laurence is going to help him."\
\
"That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow, and not\
to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position,\
or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be\
comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you\
had more sense, Meg."\
\
"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise;\
he's got heaps of talent; he's willing to work, and sure to get on, he's\
so energetic and brave. Every one likes and respects him, and I'm proud\
to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly," said\
Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.\
\
"He knows _you_ have got rich relations, child; that's the secret of his\
liking, I suspect."\
\
"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness,\
and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so," cried Meg\
indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's\
suspicions. "My John wouldn't marry for money, anymore than I would. We\
are willing to work, and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid of being poor,\
for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him, because he\
loves me, and I--"\
\
Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up\
her mind; that she had told "her John" to go away, and that he might be\
overhearing her inconsistent remarks.\
\
Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her\
pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young\
face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.\
\
"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a wilful child, and\
you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't stop;\
I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father now.\
Don't expect anything from me when you are married; your Mr. Book's\
friends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever."\
\
And, slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high\
dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her; for, when\
left alone, Meg stood a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.\
Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.\
Brooke, who said, all in one breath, "I couldn't help hearing, Meg.\
Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you _do_\
care for me a little bit."\
\
"I didn't know how much, till she abused you," began Meg.\
\
"And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?"\
\
Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately\
exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself\
forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, "Yes, John," and hiding her\
face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.\
\
Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly down\
stairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and, hearing no sound\
within, nodded and smiled, with a satisfied expression, saying to\
herself, "She has sent him away as we planned, and that affair is\
settled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it."\
\
But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the\
threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth\
nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy,\
and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an\
objectionable lover, it certainly _was_ a shock to behold the aforesaid\
enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strong-minded sister\
enthroned upon his knee, and wearing an expression of the most abject\
submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower-bath had\
suddenly fallen upon her,--for such an unexpected turning of the tables\
actually took her breath away. At the odd sound, the lovers turned and\
saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy; but "that man," as\
Jo called him, actually laughed, and said coolly, as he kissed the\
astonished new-comer, "Sister Jo, congratulate us!"\
\
That was adding insult to injury,--it was altogether too much,--and,\
making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a\
word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming\
tragically, as she burst into the room, "Oh, _do_ somebody go down\
quick; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!"\
\
Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed; and, casting herself upon\
the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news\
to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most\
agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them; so\
she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to\
the rats.\
\
Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon; but a great\
deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by\
the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans,\
and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.\
\
The tea-bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which\
he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both\
looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy\
was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity. Beth\
beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the\
young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident\
Aunt March was right in calling them as "unworldly as a pair of babies."\
No one ate much, but every one looked very happy, and the old room\
seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family\
began there.\
\
"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?" said\
Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she\
was planning to take.\
\
"No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It seems\
a year ago," answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream, lifted far above\
such common things as bread and butter.\
\
"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the\
changes have begun," said Mrs. March. "In most families there comes, now\
and then, a year full of events; this has been such an one, but it ends\
well, after all."\
\
"Hope the next will end better," muttered Jo, who found it very hard to\
see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face; for Jo loved a few\
persons very dearly, and dreaded to have their affection lost or\
lessened in any way.\
\
"I hope the third year from this _will_ end better; I mean it shall, if\
I live to work out my plans," said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if\
everything had become possible to him now.\
\
"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for\
the wedding.\
\
"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short\
time to me," answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face, never seen\
there before.\
\
"You have only to wait; _I_ am to do the work," said John, beginning his\
labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to\
shake her head, and then say to herself, with an air of relief, as the\
front door banged, "Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have a little\
sensible conversation."\
\
But Jo was mistaken; for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with\
spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for "Mrs. John Brooke,"\
and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been\
brought about by his excellent management.\
\
                  [Illustration: For Mrs. John Brooke]\
\
"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does; for when\
he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done, though the sky\
falls," said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his\
congratulations.\
\
"Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the\
future, and invite you to my wedding on the spot," answered Mr. Brooke,\
who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.\
\
"I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth; for the sight of Jo's face\
alone, on that occasion, would be worth a long journey. You don't look\
festive, ma'am; what's the matter?" asked Laurie, following her into a\
corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.\
\
"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and\
shall not say a word against it," said Jo solemnly. "You can't know how\
hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued, with a little quiver\
in her voice.\
\
"You don't give her up. You only go halves," said Laurie consolingly.\
\
"It never can be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend," sighed\
Jo.\
\
"You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know; but I'll stand\
by you, Jo, all the days of my life; upon my word I will!" and Laurie\
meant what he said.\
\
"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged; you are always a great\
comfort to me, Teddy," returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.\
\
"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right, you\
see. Meg is happy; Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately;\
grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her\
own little house. We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I\
shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad, or some\
nice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you?"\
\
"I rather think it would; but there's no knowing what may happen in\
three years," said Jo thoughtfully.\
\
"That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward, and see\
where we shall all be then? I do," returned Laurie.\
\
"I think not, for I might see something sad; and every one looks so\
happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved," and Jo's eyes\
went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect\
was a pleasant one.\
\
Father and mother sat together, quietly re-living the first chapter of\
the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing\
the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light\
of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not\
copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who\
held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead\
him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low\
seat, with the grave, quiet look which best became her; and Laurie,\
leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly\
head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long\
glass which reflected them both.\
\
                   *       *       *       *       *\
\
So grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it\
ever rises again, depends upon the reception given to the first act of\
the domestic drama called "LITTLE WOMEN."\
\

\

\
\
                     [Illustration: The Dove Cote]\
\
                                 XXIV.\
\
                                GOSSIP.\
\
\
In order that we may start afresh, and go to Meg's wedding with free\
minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\
And here let me premise, that if any of the elders think there is too\
much "lovering" in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the\
young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,\
"What _can_ you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a\
dashing young neighbor over the way?"\
\
The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the\
quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with\
his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature\
as by grace,--a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better\
than learning, the charity which calls all mankind "brother," the piety\
that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.\
\
These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which\
shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many\
admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as\
naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard\
experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the\
gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled\
women instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him, sure of\
finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their\
sins to the pure-hearted old man, and were both rebuked and saved;\
gifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of\
nobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his\
beliefs were beautiful and true, although "they wouldn't pay."\
\
To outsiders, the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so\
they did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books,\
was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and\
comforter; for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous\
times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband\
and father.\
\
The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls\
into their father's; and to both parents, who lived and labored so\
faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth, and\
bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and\
outlives death.\
\
Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we\
saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the\
hospitals and homes, still full of wounded "boys" and soldiers' widows,\
decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.\
\
John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent\
home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he\
deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love\
are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his\
discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business,\
and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence\
that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers,\
and accepted the place of book-keeper feeling better satisfied to begin\
with an honestly-earned salary, than by running any risks with borrowed\
money.\
\
Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in\
character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever; for love is\
a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt\
some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin.\
Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help\
contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid\
outfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But\
somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the\
patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her;\
and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small\
plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot\
Sallie's splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in\
Christendom.\
\
Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to\
Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of\
the best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would\
have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her\
afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted\
herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the\
fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again\
the rosy, healthy creature she had been; yet always hopeful, happy, and\
serene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, every one's friend, and an\
angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to\
know it.\
\
As long as "The Spread Eagle" paid her a dollar a column for her\
"rubbish," as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun\
her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy\
brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a\
slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place\
the name of March upon the roll of fame.\
\
Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was\
now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please\
himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,\
and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to\
get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoilt,\
and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had\
not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man\
who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over\
him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the\
knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him\
with all their hearts.\
\
Being only "a glorious human boy," of course he frolicked and flirted,\
grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions\
ordained; hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came\
perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the\
love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save\
himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible\
power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather\
prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with\
graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified\
professors, and vanquished enemies. The "men of my class" were heroes in\
the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of "our\
fellows," and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these\
great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.\
\
Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among\
them; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of\
fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her\
private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and\
Beth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to\
order them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very\
difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases,\
and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed\
for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love\
with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a\
sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment\
brings us very naturally to the "Dove-cote."\
\
That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had\
prepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was\
highly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who "went on together like a\
pair of turtle-doves, with first a bill and then a coo." It was a tiny\
house, with a little garden behind, and a lawn about as big as a\
pocket-handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,\
shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present,\
the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a\
dilapidated slop-bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,\
undecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was\
merely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted.\
But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault\
from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was\
fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in\
whole; the dining-room was so small that six people were a tight fit;\
and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of\
precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal-bin. But\
once get used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more\
complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the\
furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no\
marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little\
parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a\
stand of flowers in the bay-window, and, scattered all about, the pretty\
gifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving\
messages they brought.\
\
I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty\
because John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer\
could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's\
artistic hand; or that any store-room was ever better provided with good\
wishes, merry words, and happy hopes, than that in which Jo and her\
mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally\
certain that the spandy-new kitchen never _could_ have looked so cosey\
and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times\
over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute "Mis. Brooke\
came home." I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so\
rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece-bags; for Beth made enough\
to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three\
different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal\
china.\
\
People who hire all these things done for them never know what they\
lose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,\
and Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest,\
from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was\
eloquent of home love and tender forethought.\
\
What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping\
excursions; what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter\
arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this\
young gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as\
ever. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits,\
some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a\
bag of remarkable clothes-pins; next, a wonderful nutmeg-grater, which\
fell to pieces at the first trial; a knife-cleaner that spoilt all the\
knives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left\
the dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands;\
infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the\
deluded buyer; and every kind of tin-ware, from a toy savings-bank for\
odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own\
steam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.\
\
In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him\
"Mr. Toodles." He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee\
ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week\
beheld some fresh absurdity.\
\
Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored\
soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table\
for the first meal.\
\
"Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you\
should be happy here?" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went\
through the new kingdom, arm-in-arm; for just then they seemed to cling\
together more tenderly than ever.\
\
"Yes, mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and _so_ happy\
that I can't talk about it," answered Meg, with a look that was better\
than words.\
\
"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right," said Amy,\
coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether\
the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantle-piece.\
\
"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try\
her way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my\
errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to\
keep me from getting lazy or homesick," answered Meg tranquilly.\
\
"Sallie Moffat has four," began Amy.\
\
"If Meg had four the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis\
would have to camp in the garden," broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big\
blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door-handles.\
\
"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her\
fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that\
there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big\
one. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves\
nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first\
married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so\
that I might have the pleasure of mending them; for I got heartily sick\
of doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief."\
\
"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she\
does, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the\
servants laugh at her," said Meg.\
\
"I did, after a while; not to 'mess,' but to learn of Hannah how things\
should be done, that my servants need _not_ laugh at me. It was play\
then; but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only\
possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little\
girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You\
begin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be\
of use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of\
a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she\
wishes to be well and honestly served."\
\
"Yes, mother, I'm sure of that," said Meg, listening respectfully to the\
little lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the\
all-absorbing subject of housekeeping. "Do you know I like this room\
most of all in my baby-house," added Meg, a minute after, as they went\
upstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen-closet.\
\
Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves, and\
exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke; for that\
linen-closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married "that\
Brooke" she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in\
a quandary, when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her\
vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to\
get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy\
herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made,\
and marked, a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as\
_her_ present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked\
out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family; for Aunt March tried to look\
utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the\
old-fashioned pearls, long promised to the first bride.\
\
"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend\
who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for\
company, and that satisfied her," said Mrs. March, patting the damask\
table-cloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.\
\
"I haven't a single finger-bowl, but this is a 'set out' that will last\
me all my days, Hannah says;" and Meg looked quite contented, as well\
she might.\
\
"Toodles is coming," cried Jo from below; and they all went down to meet\
Laurie, whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives.\
\
A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt-basin\
of a hat, and a fly-away coat, came tramping down the road at a great\
pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate,\
straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out, and a hearty--\
\
"Here I am, mother! Yes, it's all right."\
\
The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him; a\
kindly questioning look, which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the\
little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.\
\
"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments.\
Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are\
getting altogether too handsome for a single lady."\
\
As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's\
hair-ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of\
mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and every one began\
to talk.\
\
"Where is John?" asked Meg anxiously.\
\
"Stopped to get the license for to-morrow, ma'am."\
\
"Which side won the last match, Teddy?" inquired Jo, who persisted in\
feeling an interest in manly sports, despite her nineteen years.\
\
"Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see."\
\
"How is the lovely Miss Randal?" asked Amy, with a significant smile.\
\
"More cruel than ever; don't you see how I'm pining away?" and Laurie\
gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.\
\
"What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg," said Beth, eying\
the knobby parcel with curiosity.\
\
"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,"\
observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of\
the girls.\
\
               [Illustration: A small watchman's rattle]\
\
"Any time when John is away, and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just\
swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood\
in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?" and Laurie gave them a sample of its\
powers that made them cover up their ears.\
\
"There's gratitude for you! and speaking of gratitude reminds me to\
mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding-cake from\
destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she\
hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked\
like a remarkably plummy one."\
\
"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie," said Meg, in a matronly\
tone.\
\
"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six\
feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days," responded the\
young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.\
"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and\
span new bower, so, as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an\
adjournment," he added presently.\
\
"Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to\
settle," said Meg, bustling away.\
\
"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for\
to-morrow," added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque\
curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.\
\
"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I\
can't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do;\
it's peculiarly becoming," said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial\
aversion in her capacious pocket, and offered him her arm to support his\
feeble steps.\
\
"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about to-morrow," began Jo,\
as they strolled away together. "You _must_ promise to behave well, and\
not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."\
\
"Not a prank."\
\
"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."\
\
"I never do; you are the one for that."\
\
"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony; I shall\
certainly laugh if you do."\
\
"You won't see me; you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you\
will obscure the prospect."\
\
"I never cry unless for some great affliction."\
\
"Such as fellows going to college, hey?" cut in Laurie, with a\
suggestive laugh.\
\
"Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company."\
\
"Exactly. I say, Jo, how is grandpa this week; pretty amiable?"\
\
"Very; why, have you got into a scrape, and want to know how he'll take\
it?" asked Jo rather sharply.\
\
"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face, and say 'All\
right,' if it wasn't?" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.\
\
"No, I don't."\
\
"Then don't go and be suspicious; I only want some money," said Laurie,\
walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.\
\
"You spend a great deal, Teddy."\
\
"Bless you, _I_ don't spend it; it spends itself, somehow, and is gone\
before I know it."\
\
"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and\
can't say 'No' to any one. We heard about Henshaw, and all you did for\
him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,"\
said Jo warmly.\
\
"Oh, he made a mountain out of a mole-hill. You wouldn't have me let\
that fine fellow work himself to death, just for the want of a little\
help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?"\
\
"Of course not; but I don't see the use of your having seventeen\
waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I\
thought you'd got over the dandy period; but every now and then it\
breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,--to\
make your head look like a scrubbing-brush, wear a strait-jacket,\
orange gloves, and clumping, square-toed boots. If it was cheap\
ugliness, I'd say nothing; but it costs as much as the other, and I\
don't get any satisfaction out of it."\
\
Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that\
the felt-basin fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded\
him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a\
rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed\
it into his pocket.\
\
"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all through\
the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get myself up\
regardless of expense, to-morrow, and be a satisfaction to my friends."\
\
"I'll leave you in peace if you'll _only_ let your hair grow. I'm not\
aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like\
a young prize-fighter," observed Jo severely.\
\
"This unassuming style promotes study; that's why we adopt it," returned\
Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily\
sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for\
quarter-of-an-inch-long stubble.\
\
"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate\
about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in\
a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little passion in the bud,\
hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder-brotherly tone, after\
a minute's silence.\
\
"Of course he had; we don't want any more marrying in this family for\
years to come. Mercy on us, what _are_ the children thinking of?" and Jo\
looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in\
their teens.\
\
"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You are\
a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left lamenting,"\
said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.\
\
"Don't be alarmed; I'm not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want\
me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a\
family."\
\
"You won't give any one a chance," said Laurie, with a sidelong glance,\
and a little more color than before in his sunburnt face. "You won't\
show the soft side of your character; and if a fellow gets a peep at it\
by accident, and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as\
Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart,--throw cold water over him,--and get\
so thorny no one dares touch or look at you."\
\
"I don't like that sort of thing; I'm too busy to be worried with\
nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't\
say any more about it; Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we\
talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get\
cross, so let's change the subject;" and Jo looked quite ready to fling\
cold water on the slightest provocation.\
\
Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a\
long low whistle, and the fearful prediction, as they parted at the\
gate, "Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."\
\
                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\
                [Illustration: The First Wedding]\
\
                                  XXV.\
\
                           THE FIRST WEDDING.\
\
\
The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that\
morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, like\
friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement\
were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one\
another what they had seen; for some peeped in at the dining-room\
windows, where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at\
the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those\
who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and\
all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby-bud, offered\
their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had\
loved and tended them so long.\
\
Meg looked very like a rose herself; for all that was best and sweetest\
in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair\
and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace,\
nor orange-flowers would she have. "I don't want to look strange or\
fixed up to-day," she said. "I don't want a fashionable wedding, but\
only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my\
familiar self."\
\
So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes\
and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her\
pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the\
valley, which "her John" liked best of all the flowers that grew.\
\
"You _do_ look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely\
that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress," cried Amy,\
surveying her with delight, when all was done.\
\
"Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, every one, and don't\
mind my dress; I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it\
to-day;" and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her\
with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed\
the old.\
\
"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few\
minutes with father quietly in the study;" and Meg ran down to perform\
these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she\
went, conscious that, in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there\
was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first\
bird from the nest.\
\
As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their\
simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which\
three years have wrought in their appearance; for all are looking their\
best just now.\
\
Jo's angles are much softened; she has learned to carry herself with\
ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,\
more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a\
fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only\
gentle words fall from her sharp tongue to-day.\
\
Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful,\
kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,\
although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches\
the young face with such pathetic patience; but Beth seldom complains,\
and always speaks hopefully of "being better soon."\
\
Amy is with truth considered "the flower of the family;" for at sixteen\
she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman--not beautiful, but\
possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the\
lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her\
dress, the droop of her hair,--unconscious, yet harmonious, and as\
attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her, for\
it never _would_ grow Grecian; so did her mouth, being too wide, and\
having a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her\
whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her\
wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls, more golden and\
abundant than ever.\
\
All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the\
summer), with blush-roses in hair and bosom; and all three looked just\
what they were,--fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in\
their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the\
romance of womanhood.\
\
There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as\
natural and homelike as possible; so when Aunt March arrived, she was\
scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to\
find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to\
catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave\
countenance, and a wine-bottle under each arm.\
\
"Upon my word, here's a state of things!" cried the old lady, taking the\
seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her lavender\
_moire_ with a great rustle. "You oughtn't to be seen till the last\
minute, child."\
\
"I'm not a show, aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to\
criticise my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy to\
care what any one says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little\
wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer;" and away\
went Meg to help "that man" in his highly improper employment.\
\
Mr. Brooke didn't even say "Thank you," but as he stooped for the\
unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding-door,\
with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket-handkerchief, with\
a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.\
\
A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous\
exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!" caused a\
momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived,\
and "the party came in," as Beth used to say when a child.\
\
"Don't let that young giant come near me; he worries me worse than\
mosquitoes," whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled, and\
Laurie's black head towered above the rest.\
\
"He has promised to be very good to-day, and he _can_ be perfectly\
elegant if he likes," returned Amy, gliding away to warn Hercules to\
beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady\
with a devotion that nearly distracted her.\
\
There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room\
as Mr. March and the young pair took their places under the green arch.\
Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up; the\
fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the\
service more beautiful and solemn; the bridegroom's hand trembled\
visibly, and no one heard his replies; but Meg looked straight up in her\
husband's eyes, and said, "I will!" with such tender trust in her own\
face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced, and Aunt March sniffed\
audibly.\
\
Jo did _not_ cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved\
from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring\
fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his\
wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,\
but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of\
sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.\
\
It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly\
married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and, turning, gave it\
with her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked\
more like a rose than ever, for every one availed themselves of their\
privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,\
adorned with a head-dress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her\
in the hall, crying, with a sob and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a\
hundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."\
\
Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried\
to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light.\
There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little\
house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of\
cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March\
shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were\
found to be the only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried\
round. No one said anything, however, till Laurie, who insisted on\
serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand\
and a puzzled expression on his face.\
\
"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered, "or am I\
merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this\
morning?"\
\
"No; your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March\
actually sent some, but father put away a little for Beth, and\
despatched the rest to the Soldiers' Home. You know he thinks that wine\
should be used only in illness, and mother says that neither she nor her\
daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof."\
\
Meg spoke seriously, and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh; but he\
did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous\
way, "I like that! for I've seen enough harm done to wish other women\
would think as you do."\
\
"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" and there was an anxious\
accent in Meg's voice.\
\
"No; I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either; this\
is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common\
as water, and almost as harmless, I don't care for it; but when a pretty\
girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see."\
\
"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,\
Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest\
day of my life."\
\
A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,\
for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if\
he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs; and, feeling her\
power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,\
but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,\
and a smile which said, "No one can refuse me anything to-day." Laurie\
certainly could not; and, with an answering smile, he gave her his hand,\
saying heartily, "I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"\
\
"I thank you, very, very much."\
\
"And I drink 'long life to your resolution,' Teddy," cried Jo, baptizing\
him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass, and beamed\
approvingly upon him.\
\
So the toast was drunk, the pledge made, and loyally kept, in spite of\
many temptations; for, with instinctive wisdom, the girls had seized a\
happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all\
his life.\
\
After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through house\
and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg and John\
happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass-plot, when\
Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to\
this unfashionable wedding.\
\
"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband\
and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in\
couples outside!" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with\
such infectious spirit and skill that every one else followed their\
example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol,\
began it; others rapidly joined in; even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's\
hesitation, threw her train over her arm, and whisked Ned into the ring.\
But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March; for when the\
stately old gentleman _chass\'e9ed_ solemnly up to the old lady, she just\
tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands\
with the rest, and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks\
pervaded the garden, like butterflies on a midsummer day.\
\
Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people\
began to go.\
\
"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well; but I think you'll\
be sorry for it," said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as\
he led her to the carriage, "You've got a treasure, young man, see that\
you deserve it."\
\
"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I don't\
see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it," observed Mrs. Moffat\
to her husband, as they drove away.\
\
"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get\
one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly\
satisfied," said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy-chair to\
rest, after the excitement of the morning.\
\
"I'll do my best to gratify you, sir," was Laurie's unusually dutiful\
reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his button-hole.\
\
The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had\
was the quiet walk with John, from the old home to the new. When she\
came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and\
straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say\
"good-by," as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.\
\
"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love\
you any the less for loving John so much," she said, clinging to her\
mother, with full eyes, for a moment. "I shall come every day, father,\
and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I _am_\
married. Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls\
will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank\
you all for my happy wedding-day. Good-by, good-by!"\
\
They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender\
pride, as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands\
full of flowers, and the June sunshine brightening her happy face,--and\
so Meg's married life began.\

                   [Illustration: Artistic Attempts]\
\
                                 XXVI.\
\
                           ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS.\
\
\
It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and\
genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this\
distinction through much tribulation; for, mistaking enthusiasm for\
inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.\
For a long time there was a lull in the "mud-pie" business, and she\
devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed\
such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant\
and profitable. But overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid\
aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,\
the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration; for the odor of\
burning wood pervaded the house at all hours; smoke issued from attic\
and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about\
promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and\
the dinner-bell at her door, in case of fire. Raphael's face was found\
boldly executed on the under side of the moulding-board, and Bacchus on\
the head of a beer-barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the\
sugar-bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied\
kindlings for some time.\
\
From fire to oil was a natural transition for burnt fingers, and Amy\
fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her\
out with his cast-off palettes, brushes, and colors; and she daubed\
away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on\
land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken\
prizes at an agricultural fair; and the perilous pitching of her vessels\
would have produced sea-sickness in the most nautical observer, if the\
utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not\
convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and\
dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,\
suggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces, with a lurid streak in\
the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants,\
Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange\
lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash\
in the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor's shirt or a\
king's robe, as the spectator pleased.\
\
Charcoal portraits came next; and the entire family hung in a row,\
looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coal-bin. Softened\
into crayon sketches, they did better; for the likenesses were good, and\
Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced\
"wonderfully fine." A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly\
casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off\
closet-shelves on to people's heads. Children were enticed in as models,\
till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy\
to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line,\
however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which\
quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook\
to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an\
unearthly bumping and screaming, and running to the rescue, found the\
young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed, with her foot held fast\
in a pan-full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity.\
With much difficulty and some danger she was dug out; for Jo was so\
overcome with laughter while she excavated, that her knife went too far,\
cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt,\
at least.\
\
       [Illustration: Her foot held fast in a panful of plaster]\
\
After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her\
to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing\
for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to\
book "a delicious bit," composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and\
a broken mullein-stalk, or "a heavenly mass of clouds," that looked like\
a choice display of feather-beds when done. She sacrificed her\
complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun, to study light\
and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose, trying after "points of\
sight," or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.\
\
If "genius is eternal patience," as Michael Angelo affirms, Amy\
certainly had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in\
spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing\
that in time she should do something worthy to be called "high art."\
\
She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she\
had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she\
never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better; for she was one\
of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends\
everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate\
souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star.\
Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an\
instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right\
thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and\
was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to\
court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do."\
\
One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in "our best society,"\
without being quite sure what the _best_ really was. Money, position,\
fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable\
things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed\
them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not\
admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she\
cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the\
opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty\
now excluded her.\
\
"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine\
lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy\
refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and\
that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.\
\
"I want to ask a favor of you, mamma," Amy said, coming in, with an\
important air, one day.\
\
"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose eyes the\
stately young lady still remained "the baby."\
\
"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate\
for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to\
see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things\
they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and\
I am grateful, for they are all rich, and know I am poor, yet they never\
made any difference."\
\
"Why should they?" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls\
called her "Maria Theresa air."\
\
"You know as well as I that it _does_ make a difference with nearly\
every one, so don't ruffle up, like a dear, motherly hen, when your\
chickens get pecked by smarter birds; the ugly duckling turned out a\
swan, you know;" and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a\
happy temper and hopeful spirit.\
\
Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,--\
\
"Well, my swan, what is your plan?"\
\
"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them a\
drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and\
make a little artistic _f\'eate_ for them."\
\
"That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches,\
fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"\
\
"Oh dear, no! we must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and\
ice-cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my\
lunch to be proper and elegant, though I _do_ work for my living."\
\
"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning to look\
sober.\
\
"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."\
\
"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them\
about."\
\
"Why, mother, how _can_ you think of such a thing? Not more than six or\
eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach-wagon, and borrow Mr.\
Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of _char-\'e0-banc_.)\
\
"All this will be expensive, Amy."\
\
"Not very; I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."\
\
"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and\
the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be\
pleasanter to them, as a change, if nothing more, and much better for us\
than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and attempting a style not\
in keeping with our circumstances?"\
\
"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know\
that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help\
a little; and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,"\
said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into\
obstinacy.\
\
Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it\
was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she\
would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice\
as much as they did salts and senna.\
\
"Very well, Amy; if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way\
through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say\
no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll\
do my best to help you."\
\
"Thanks, mother; you are always _so_ kind;" and away went Amy to lay her\
plan before her sisters.\
\
Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she\
possessed, from her little house itself to her very best salt-spoons.\
But Jo frowned upon the whole project, and would have nothing to do with\
it at first.\
\
"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and\
turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a\
sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle\
to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a\
_coup\'e9_," said Jo, who, being called from the tragical climax of her\
novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.\
\
"I _don't_ truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!"\
returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions\
arose. "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great\
deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you\
call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go\
into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I\
mean to make the most of every chance that comes. _You_ can go through\
the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it\
independence, if you like. That's not my way."\
\
When Amy whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best\
of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo\
carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an\
unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an\
argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good\
hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable\
turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day\
to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as "a\
nonsensical business."\
\
The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday\
was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her\
week's work was deranged, and prophesied that "ef the washin' and\
ironin' warn't done reg'lar nothin' would go well anywheres." This hitch\
in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the\
whole concern; but Amy's motto was "Nil desperandum," and having made up\
her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles.\
To begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well: the chicken was\
tough, the tongue too salt, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.\
Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon; and\
various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up\
rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold and took to her bed, Meg had\
an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a\
divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were\
uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.\
\
"If it hadn't been for mother I never should have got through," as Amy\
declared afterward, and gratefully remembered when "the best joke of the\
season" was entirely forgotten by everybody else.\
\
If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on\
Tuesday,--an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last\
degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which\
is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a\
little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late\
for any one else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people\
out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be\
got in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby; but\
without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skilfully made the\
best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\
carpet, covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy, and\
filling up empty corners with home-made statuary, which gave an artistic\
air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.\
\
The lunch looked charmingly; and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\
it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\
would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and mother\
were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the\
scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, an\
aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything\
would allow, and, as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with\
anticipations of the happy moment, when, lunch safely over, she should\
drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights; for\
the "cherry-bounce" and the broken bridge were her strong points.\
\
Then came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\
to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart\
shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\
ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the\
exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\
perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\
\
"No doubt about the weather to-day; they will certainly come, so we must\
fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke her next\
morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\
said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting\
a little stale.\
\
"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad to-day,"\
said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\
placid despair.\
\
"Use the chicken, then; the toughness won't matter in a salad," advised\
his wife.\
\
"Hannah left it on the kitchen-table a minute, and the kittens got at\
it. I'm very sorry, Amy," added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.\
\
"Then I _must_ have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said Amy\
decidedly.\
\
"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\
of a martyr.\
\
"You'd come bringing it home under your arm, without any paper, just to\
try me. I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\
fail.\
\
Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travelling-basket, she\
departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit, and\
fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her\
desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing, to prevent further\
loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own\
forethought.\
\
As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\
Amy pocketed her veil, and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\
find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card\
full of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer, who\
entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\
"Good-morning, Miss March," and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\
most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out\
before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and,\
congratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress,\
returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.\
\
They got on excellently; for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\
learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away\
in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to\
the door, she upset the basket, and--oh, horror!--the lobster, in all\
its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a\
Tudor.\
\
"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious youth,\
poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\
to hand out the basket after the old lady.\
\
"Please don't--it's--it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red\
as her fish.\
\
                [Illustration: Please don't, it's mine]\
\
"Oh, really, I beg pardon; it's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?" said\
Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that\
did credit to his breeding.\
\
Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\
and said, laughing,--\
\
"Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad he's to make, and to\
see the charming young ladies who are to eat it?"\
\
Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind\
were touched: the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing\
reminiscences, and curiosity about "the charming young ladies" diverted\
his mind from the comical mishap.\
\
"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I sha'n't see\
them; that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.\
\
She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,\
thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of\
dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the\
preparations which now seemed more irksome than before; and at twelve\
o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested\
in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's\
failure by a grand success to-day; so she ordered the "cherry-bounce,"\
and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.\
\
"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go into the porch to meet\
them; it looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time\
after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word.\
But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression,\
for, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.\
\
"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will\
be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl," cried\
Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a\
laugh.\
\
In came Amy, quite calm, and delightfully cordial to the one guest who\
had kept her promise; the rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn,\
played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most\
hilarious set; for it was impossible to entirely control the merriment\
which possessed them. The remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of, the\
studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy\
ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her\
friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when "the party went\
out."\
\
As she came walking in, looking very tired, but as composed as ever, she\
observed that every vestige of the unfortunate _f\'eate_ had disappeared,\
except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\
\
"You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear," said her mother,\
as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\
\
"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\
thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\
\
"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so\
much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours," asked Meg\
soberly.\
\
"Take it all; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will\
mould before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of\
the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\
\
"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they sat down\
to ice-cream and salad for the second time in two days.\
\
A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the\
whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,\
"Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn"--here\
a general explosion of laughter cut short the "history of sallets," to\
the great surprise of the learned gentleman.\
\
"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels: Germans\
like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this; and there's no reason you\
should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried Amy, wiping\
her eyes.\
\
"I thought I _should_ have died when I saw you two girls rattling about\
in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell,\
and mother waiting in state to receive the throng," sighed Jo, quite\
spent with laughter.\
\
"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to\
satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.\
\
"I _am_ satisfied; I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault\
that it failed; I comfort myself with that," said Amy, with a little\
quiver in her voice. "I thank you all very much for helping me, and I'll\
thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least."\
\
No one did for several months; but the word "_f\'eate_" always produced a\
general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral\
lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch-guard.\

\
                           LITERARY LESSONS.\
\
\
Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good-luck penny in her\
path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\
have given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her\
in this wise.\
\
Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\
scribbling suit, and "fall into a vortex," as she expressed it, writing\
away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\
finished she could find no peace. Her "scribbling suit" consisted of a\
black woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\
cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\
she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap\
was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\
periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\
semi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, "Does genius burn, Jo?" They\
did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\
observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive\
article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\
hard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\
askew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and\
cast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew; and\
not until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow, did any\
one dare address Jo.\
\
She did not think herself a genius by any means; but when the writing\
fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a\
blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\
safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and\
dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood\
untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which\
blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even\
if they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week\
or two, and then she emerged from her "vortex," hungry, sleepy, cross,\
or despondent.\
\
She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed\
upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue\
was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on\
the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for\
such an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil\
would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories\
of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price\
of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder\
riddles than that of the Sphinx.\
\
They were early; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo\
amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\
seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads,\
and bonnets to match, discussing Woman's Rights and making tatting.\
Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\
hand, a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\
old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On\
her right, her only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a\
newspaper.\
\
It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\
idly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\
the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling\
over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young\
gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each\
other close by, and a dishevelled female was flying away in the\
background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw\
her looking, and, with boyish good-nature, offered half his paper,\
saying bluntly, "Want to read it? That's a first-rate story."\
\
Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for\
lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,\
mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light\
literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's\
invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the\
_dramatis person\'e6_, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\
\
"Prime, isn't it?" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last\
paragraph of her portion.\
\
"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried," returned Jo,\
amused at his admiration of the trash.\
\
"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good\
living out of such stories, they say;" and he pointed to the name of\
Mrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.\
\
"Do you know her?" asked Jo, with sudden interest.\
\
"No; but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the\
office where this paper is printed."\
\
"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?" and Jo\
looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly-sprinkled\
exclamation-points that adorned the page.\
\
"Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for\
writing it."\
\
Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Prof.\
Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and\
hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,\
and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its\
columns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the\
audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the\
first founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her\
story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the\
elopement or after the murder.\
\
She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to\
the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\
"genius took to burning." Jo had never tried this style before,\
contenting herself with very mild romances for the "Spread Eagle." Her\
theatrical experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for\
they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,\
and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\
limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\
make it, and, having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\
earthquake, as a striking and appropriate _d\'e9nouement_. The manuscript\
was privately despatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if\
the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she\
would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\
\
Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\
keep a secret; but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\
hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\
almost took her breath away; for on opening it, a check for a hundred\
dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had\
been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable\
gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense\
happiness he was giving a fellow-creature, I think he would devote his\
leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement; for Jo valued the\
letter more than the money, because it was encouraging; and after years\
of effort it was _so_ pleasant to find that she had learned to do\
something, though it was only to write a sensation story.\
\
            [Illustration: A check for one hundred dollars]\
\
A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed\
herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the\
letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won\
the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came\
every one read and praised it; though after her father had told her that\
the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy\
quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way,--\
\
"You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the\
money."\
\
"_I_ think the money is the best part of it. What _will_ you do with\
such a fortune?" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a\
reverential eye.\
\
"Send Beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two," answered Jo\
promptly.\
\
"Oh, how splendid! No, I can't do it, dear, it would be so selfish,"\
cried Beth, who had clapped her thin hands, and taken a long breath, as\
if pining for fresh ocean-breezes; then stopped herself, and motioned\
away the check which her sister waved before her.\
\
"Ah, but you shall go, I've set my heart on it; that's what I tried for,\
and that's why I succeeded. I never get on when I think of myself alone,\
so it will help me to work for you, don't you see? Besides, Marmee needs\
the change, and she won't leave you, so you _must_ go. Won't it be fun\
to see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always\
cures her patients!"\
\
To the sea side they went, after much discussion; and though Beth didn't\
come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\
while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was\
satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\
a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\
did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\
house; for by the magic of a pen, her "rubbish" turned into comforts for\
them all. "The Duke's Daughter" paid the butcher's bill, "A Phantom\
Hand" put down a new carpet, and the "Curse of the Coventrys" proved the\
blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\
\
Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\
side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction\
which comes from hearty work of head or hand; and to the inspiration of\
necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the\
world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy\
richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could\
supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\
\
Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market; and,\
encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and\
fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her\
confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three\
publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut\
it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly\
admired.\
\
"Now I must either bundle it back into my tin-kitchen to mould, pay for\
printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers, and get what I can\
for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more\
convenient; so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important\
subject," said Jo, calling a family council.\
\
"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\
and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen," was her\
father's advice; and he practised as he preached, having waited\
patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\
haste to gather it, even now, when it was sweet and mellow.\
\
"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by making the trial than by\
waiting," said Mrs. March. "Criticism is the best test of such work, for\
it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her to do\
better next time. We are too partial; but the praise and blame of\
outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money."\
\
"Yes," said Jo, knitting her brows, "that's just it; I've been fussing\
over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or\
indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\
take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it."\
\
"I wouldn't leave out a word of it; you'll spoil it if you do, for the\
interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the\
people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,"\
said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable\
novel ever written.\
\
"But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and\
dramatic, and let the characters tell the story,'" interrupted Jo,\
turning to the publisher's note.\
\
"Do as he tells you; he knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a good,\
popular book, and get as much money as you can. By and by, when, you've\
got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and\
metaphysical people in your novels," said Amy, who took a strictly\
practical view of the subject.\
\
"Well," said Jo, laughing, "if my people _are_ 'philosophical and\
metaphysical,' it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\
except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some of his wise\
ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth,\
what do you say?"\
\
"I should so like to see it printed _soon_," was all Beth said, and\
smiled in saying it; but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\
word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\
candor, which chilled Jo's heart, for a minute, with a foreboding fear,\
and decided her to make her little venture "soon."\
\
So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\
her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of\
pleasing every one, she took every one's advice; and, like the old man\
and his donkey in the fable, suited nobody.\
\
Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\
into it; so that was allowed to remain, though she had her doubts about\
it. Her mother thought that there _was_ a trifle too much description;\
out, therefore, it nearly all came, and with it many necessary links in\
the story. Meg admired the tragedy; so Jo piled up the agony to suit\
her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in\
life, Jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the sombre\
character of the story. Then, to complete the ruin, she cut it down one\
third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked\
robin, out into the big, busy world, to try its fate.\
\
Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it; likewise\
plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that\
she was thrown into a state of bewilderment, from which it took her some\
time to recover.\
\
"You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when\
it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising\
book or broken all the ten commandments?" cried poor Jo, turning over a\
heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one\
minute, wrath and dire dismay the next. "This man says 'An exquisite\
book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and\
healthy,'" continued the perplexed authoress. "The next, 'The theory of\
the book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and\
unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't\
believe in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don't see\
how this critic _can_ be right. Another says, 'It's one of the best\
American novels which has appeared for years' (I know better than that);\
and the next asserts that 'though it is original, and written with great\
force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun of\
it, some over-praise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to\
expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I wish I'd\
printed it whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged."\
\
Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally;\
yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so\
well, and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for those\
whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an author's\
best education; and when the first soreness was over, she could laugh at\
her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel herself the\
wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.\
\
"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me," she said stoutly;\
"and I've got the joke on my side, after all; for the parts that were\
taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,\
and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced\
'charmingly natural, tender, and true.' So I'll comfort myself with\
that; and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another."\

\
                         DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES.\
\
\
Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the\
determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home a\
paradise; he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously\
every day, and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much\
love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\
succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil\
one; for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\
bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She was too\
tired, sometimes, even to smile; John grew dyspeptic after a course of\
dainty dishes, and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she\
soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\
carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\
and then see if _his_ work would stand impatient tugs and clumsy fingers\
any better than hers.\
\
They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't live\
on love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though she\
beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee-pot; nor did Meg miss any\
of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his\
kiss with the tender inquiry, "Shall I send home veal or mutton for\
dinner, darling?" The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but\
it became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change\
for the better. At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it\
like children; then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of\
the head of a family upon his shoulders; and Meg laid by her cambric\
wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with\
more energy than discretion.\
\
While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's Receipt\
Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems\
with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat\
up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately\
despatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all\
eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with\
John over the account-books usually produced a temporary lull in the\
culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor\
man was put through a course of bread-pudding, hash, and warmed-over\
coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy\
fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her\
domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without,--a\
family jar.\
\
Fired with a housewifely wish to see her store-room stocked with\
home-made preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\
was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots, and an extra\
quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe, and were to be\
attended to at once. As John firmly believed that "my wife" was equal to\
anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she\
should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\
pleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little\
pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\
her. With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\
elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\
bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\
success; for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array\
of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\
the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\
resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\
straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best; she asked\
advice of Mrs. Cornelius; she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\
did that she had left undone; she reboiled, resugared, and restrained,\
but that dreadful stuff wouldn't "_jell_."\
\
She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask mother to lend a hand, but\
John and she had agreed that they would never annoy any one with their\
private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that\
last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one; but\
they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on without\
help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the\
plan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot\
summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen,\
wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.\
\
Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said,--\
\
"My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he\
likes. I shall always be prepared; there shall be no flurry, no\
scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good\
dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you please,\
and be sure of a welcome from me."\
\
How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear\
her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior\
wife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never\
happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to\
distinguish herself till now. It always happens so in this vale of\
tears; there is an inevitability about such things which we can only\
wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.\
\
If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been\
unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the year, to\
bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating himself that\
a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it\
would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant anticipations of\
the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came running\
out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the\
irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.\
\
It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the\
Dove-cote. The front door usually stood hospitably open; now it was not\
only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps. The\
parlor-windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife\
sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her\
hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her\
guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared, but a\
sanguinary-looking boy asleep under the currant-bushes.\
\
"I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while I\
look up Mrs. Brooke," said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.\
\
Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burnt sugar, and\
Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. He paused\
discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared; but he could both see\
and hear, and, being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.\
\
In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair; one edition of jelly was\
trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was\
burning gayly on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly\
eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly\
liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat\
sobbing dismally.\
\
"My dearest girl, what is the matter?" cried John, rushing in, with\
awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret\
consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\
\
"O John, I _am_ so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've been at it\
till I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I _shall_ die!" and the\
exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet\
welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized\
at the same time as the floor.\
\
"What worries you, dear? Has anything dreadful happened?" asked the\
anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was\
all askew.\
\
"Yes," sobbed Meg despairingly.\
\
"Tell me quick, then. Don't cry, I can bear anything better than that.\
Out with it, love."\
\
"The--the jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"\
\
John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward; and the\
derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which\
put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.\
\
"Is that all? Fling it out of window, and don't bother any more about\
it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it; but for heaven's sake don't have\
hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner, and--"\
\
John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a\
tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled\
indignation, reproach, and dismay,--\
\
"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how _could_ you\
do such a thing?"\
\
"Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't\
be helped now," said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\
\
"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to\
have remembered how busy I was," continued Meg petulantly; for even\
turtle-doves will peck when ruffled.\
\
"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for\
I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you have\
always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and hang me if\
I ever do again!" added John, with an aggrieved air.\
\
"I should hope not! Take him away at once; I can't see him, and there\
isn't any dinner."\
\
"Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the\
pudding you promised?" cried John, rushing to the larder.\
\
"I hadn't time to cook anything; I meant to dine at mother's. I'm sorry,\
but I was _so_ busy;" and Meg's tears began again.\
\
John was a mild man, but he was human; and after a long day's work, to\
come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty\
table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or\
manner. He restrained himself, however, and the little squall would have\
blown over, but for one unlucky word.\
\
"It's a scrape, I acknowledge; but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\
through, and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but just exert\
yourself a bit, and knock us up something to eat. We're both as hungry\
as hunters, so we sha'n't mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and\
bread and cheese; we won't ask for jelly."\
\
He meant it for a good-natured joke; but that one word sealed his fate.\
Meg thought it was _too_ cruel to hint about her sad failure, and the\
last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\
\
"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can; I'm too used up to\
'exert' myself for any one. It's like a man to propose a bone and vulgar\
bread and cheese for company. I won't have anything of the sort in my\
house. Take that Scott up to mother's, and tell him I'm away, sick,\
dead,--anything. I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and my\
jelly as much as you like: you won't have anything else here;" and\
having delivered her defiance all in one breath, Meg cast away her\
pinafore, and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own\
room.\
\
What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew; but Mr.\
Scott was not taken "up to mother's," and when Meg descended, after they\
had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous lunch\
which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten "a\
much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\
sweet stuff, and hide the pots."\
\
Meg longed to go and tell mother; but a sense of shame at her own\
short-comings, of loyalty to John, "who might be cruel, but nobody\
should know it," restrained her; and after a summary clearing up, she\
dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\
forgiven.\
\
Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light. He\
had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little wife as\
well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his friend\
enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again. But John was\
angry, though he did not show it; he felt that Meg had got him into a\
scrape, and then deserted him in his hour of need. "It wasn't fair to\
tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when\
he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in\
the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't! and Meg\
must know it." He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the\
flurry was over, and he strolled home, after seeing Scott off, a milder\
mood came over him. "Poor little thing! it was hard upon her when she\
tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she\
was young. I must be patient and teach her." He hoped she had not gone\
home--he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was ruffled\
again at the mere thought of it; and then the fear that Meg would cry\
herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\
resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\
she had failed in her duty to her spouse.\
\
Meg likewise resolved to be "calm and kind, but firm," and show _him_\
his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed\
and comforted, as she was sure of being; but, of course, she did nothing\
of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\
as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\
\
John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe; but, feeling\
that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\
leisurely in, and laid himself upon the sofa, with the singularly\
relevant remark,--\
\
"We are going to have a new moon, my dear."\
\
"I've no objection," was Meg's equally soothing remark.\
\
A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke,\
and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went\
to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\
figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new\
rosettes for her slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\
spoke; both looked quite "calm and firm," and both felt desperately\
uncomfortable.\
\
          [Illustration: Both felt desperately uncomfortable]\
\
"Oh dear," thought Meg, "married life is very trying, and does need\
infinite patience, as well as love, as mother says." The word "mother"\
suggested other maternal counsels, given long ago, and received with\
unbelieving protests.\
\
"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\
and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, but never\
will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is\
very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait, though you\
call him 'fussy.' Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will\
give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a\
temper, not like ours,--one flash, and then all over,--but the white,\
still anger, that is seldom stirred, but once kindled, is hard to\
quench. Be careful, very careful, not to wake this anger against\
yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch\
yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\
the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\
the way for bitter sorrow and regret."\
\
These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\
especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement; her own\
hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\
own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\
such a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at him with tears in\
her eyes, but he did not see them; she put down her work and got up,\
thinking, "I _will_ be the first to say, 'Forgive me,'" but he did not\
seem to hear her; she went very slowly across the room, for pride was\
hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head. For a\
minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it; then came the thought,\
"This is the beginning, I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\
myself with," and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\
forehead. Of course that settled it; the penitent kiss was better than a\
world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\
tenderly,--\
\
"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly-pots. Forgive me,\
dear, I never will again!"\
\
But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\
declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made; for family\
peace was preserved in that little family jar.\
\
After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\
served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\
course; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\
everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a happy\
fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the\
way home.\
\
In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat\
renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\
the little house, or inviting "that poor dear" to come in and spend the\
day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\
felt lonely; all were busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing\
to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell out that\
Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. Seeing\
Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because\
she had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the\
coveted trifles; but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn't like\
it; and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked\
infinitely worse.\
\
She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\
her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\
more,--his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she\
liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny,\
pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's wife.\
Till now, she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her little\
account-books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But\
that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted her, like\
many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg didn't like to\
be pitied and made to feel poor; it irritated her, but she was ashamed\
to confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying\
something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she had to economize. She\
always felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom\
necessaries; but then they cost so little, it wasn't worth worrying\
about; so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping\
excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\
\
But the trifles cost more than one would imagine; and when she cast up\
her accounts at the end of the month, the sum total rather scared her.\
John was busy that month, and left the bills to her; the next month he\
was absent; but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\
never forgot it. A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and it\
weighed upon her conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\
longed for a new one,--just a handsome light one for parties, her black\
silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\
for girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five\
dollars apiece at New Year; that was only a month to wait, and here was\
a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she\
only dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers; but would\
he think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but\
another five-and-twenty out of the household fund? That was the\
question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to loan the money,\
and with the best intentions in life, had tempted Meg beyond her\
strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering\
folds, and said, "A bargain, I assure you, ma'am." She answered, "I'll\
take it;" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and\
she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven\
away, feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after\
her.\
\
             [Illustration: A bargain, I assure you, ma'am]\
\
When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\
spreading forth the lovely silk; but it looked less silvery now, didn't\
become her, after all, and the words "fifty dollars" seemed stamped like\
a pattern down each breadth. She put it away; but it haunted her, not\
delightfully, as a new dress should, but dreadfully, like the ghost of a\
folly that was not easily laid. When John got out his books that night,\
Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life, she was\
afraid of her husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be\
stern; and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her\
out, but didn't mean to let her know it. The house-bills were all paid,\
the books all in order. John had praised her, and was undoing the old\
pocket-book which they called the "bank," when Meg, knowing that it was\
quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously,--\
\
"You haven't seen my private expense book yet."\
\
John never asked to see it; but she always insisted on his doing so, and\
used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted,\
and made him guess what "piping" was, demand fiercely the meaning of a\
"hug-me-tight," or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds,\
a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and\
cost five or six dollars. That night he looked as if he would like the\
fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\
extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent\
wife.\
\
The little book was brought slowly out, and laid down before him. Meg\
got behind his chair under pretence of smoothing the wrinkles out of his\
tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic increasing\
with every word,--\
\
"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been\
dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have things,\
you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did; and my New-Year's\
money will partly pay for it: but I was sorry after I'd done it, for I\
knew you'd think it wrong in me."\
\
John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying good-humoredly,\
"Don't go and hide. I won't beat you if you _have_ got a pair of killing\
boots; I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does\
pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones."\
\
That had been one of her last "trifles," and John's eye had fallen on it\
as he spoke. "Oh, what _will_ he say when he comes to that awful fifty\
dollars!" thought Meg, with a shiver.\
\
"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress," she said, with the calmness\
of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\
\
"Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total,' as Mr. Mantalini says?"\
\
That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with\
the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and\
answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and her head at\
the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\
without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added. For a\
minute the room was very still; then John said slowly,--but she could\
feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure,--\
\
"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the\
furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days."\
\
"It isn't made or trimmed," sighed Meg faintly, for a sudden\
recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.\
\
"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,\
but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she\
gets it on," said John dryly.\
\
"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't mean to waste\
your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up so. I\
can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and pitying me\
because I don't. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and I'm tired of\
being poor."\
\
The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\
he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\
pleasures for Meg's sake. She could have bitten her tongue out the\
minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away, and got up,\
saying, with a little quiver in his voice, "I was afraid of this; I do\
my best, Meg." If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\
have broken her heart like those few words. She ran to him and held him\
close, crying, with repentant tears, "O John, my dear, kind,\
hard-working boy, I didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and\
ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!"\
\
He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach;\
but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be\
forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again. She had\
promised to love him for better for worse; and then she, his wife, had\
reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings recklessly.\
It was dreadful; and the worst of it was John went on so quietly\
afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in\
town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to\
sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick; and the discovery that\
John had countermanded the order for his new great-coat reduced her to a\
state of despair which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in\
answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, "I can't afford it,\
my dear."\
\
Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall, with\
her face buried in the old great-coat, crying as if her heart would\
break.\
\
They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\
better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\
given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\
a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\
and failures of those he loved.\
\
Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\
truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The good-natured Mrs.\
Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\
of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the great-coat, and,\
when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\
silk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\
present, and what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home\
early, Meg gadded no more; and that great-coat was put on in the morning\
by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted little\
wife. So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new\
experience,--the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.\
\
Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dove-cote, one Saturday,\
with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals; for\
Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the\
other.\
\
"How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you tell me\
before I came home?" began Laurie, in a loud whisper.\
\
"Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of 'em is upstairs a worshipin';\
we didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the parlor, and I'll\
send 'em down to you," with which somewhat involved reply Hannah\
vanished, chuckling ecstatically.\
\
Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon\
a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and\
there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.\
\
"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms," she said invitingly.\
\
Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him\
with an imploring gesture: "No, thank you, I'd rather not. I shall drop\
it or smash it, as sure as fate."\
\
"Then you sha'n't see your nevvy," said Jo decidedly, turning as if to\
go.\
\
"I will, I will! only you must be responsible for damages;" and, obeying\
orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his\
arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah, and John\
caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with\
two babies instead of one.\
\
[Illustration: Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put\
                             into his arms]\
\
No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough\
to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious\
innocents to the hilarious spectators, with such dismay that Jo sat down\
on the floor and screamed.\
\
"Twins, by Jupiter!" was all he said for a minute; then, turning to the\
women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added, "Take\
'em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em."\
\
John rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\
as if already initiated into the mysteries of baby-tending, while Laurie\
laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.\
\
"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have you told,\
for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done\
it," said Jo, when she got her breath.\
\
"I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they boys?\
What are you going to name them? Let's have another look. Hold me up,\
Jo; for upon my life it's one too many for me," returned Laurie,\
regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\
looking at a pair of infantile kittens.\
\
"Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?" said the proud papa, beaming upon\
the little, red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\
\
"Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?" and Laurie bent\
like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\
\
"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\
fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one\
brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy," said wicked Jo.\
\
"I'm afraid they mightn't like it," began Laurie, with unusual timidity\
in such matters.\
\
"Of course they will; they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir!"\
commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.\
\
Laurie screwed up his face, and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each\
little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\
\
"There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy; see him kick; he\
hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch\
into a man of your own size, will you?" cried Laurie, delighted with a\
poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\
\
"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and\
grandmother. We shall call her Daisy, so as not to have two Megs, and I\
suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name," said\
Amy, with aunt-like interest.\
\
"Name him Demijohn, and call him 'Demi' for short," said Laurie.\
\
"Daisy and Demi,--just the thing! I _knew_ Teddy would do it," cried Jo,\
clapping her hands.\
\
Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were "Daisy" and\
"Demi" to the end of the chapter.\
\
\
\
\
                                 XXIX.\
\
                                 CALLS.\
\
\
                         [Illustration: Calls]\
\
"Come, Jo, it's time."\
\
"For what?"\
\
"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half\
a dozen calls with me to-day?"\
\
"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't\
think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when a\
single one upsets me for a week."\
\
"Yes, you did; it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon\
of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our\
neighbors' visits."\
\
"If it was fair--that was in the bond; and I stand to the letter of my\
bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east; it's _not_ fair,\
and I don't go."\
\
"Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you\
pride yourself on keeping promises; so be honorable; come and do your\
duty, and then be at peace for another six months."\
\
At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking; for she was\
mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself\
because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking\
to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make\
calls in her best array, on a warm July day. She hated calls of the\
formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,\
bribe, or promise. In the present instance, there was no escape; and\
having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she\
smelt thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and\
gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.\
\
"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't intend\
to make calls in that state, I hope," cried Amy, surveying her with\
amazement.\
\
"Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable; quite proper for a dusty\
walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for\
me, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant\
as you please: it pays for you to be fine; it doesn't for me, and\
furbelows only worry me."\
\
"Oh dear!" sighed Amy; "now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me\
distracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure it's no\
pleasure to me to go to-day, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's\
no one to pay it but you and me. I'll do anything for you, Jo, if you'll\
only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can\
talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so\
beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you. I'm afraid to go alone;\
do come and take care of me."\
\
"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old\
sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and\
your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't know which is the most\
absurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander\
of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly; will that satisfy you?" said\
Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamb-like submission.\
\
"You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I'll tell\
you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good\
impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only try\
to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the\
pink rose in your bonnet; it's becoming, and you look too sober in your\
plain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief.\
We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can\
have my dove-colored one."\
\
While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them; not\
without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled\
into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet\
strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she\
put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out\
the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the\
present mission was to her feelings; and when she had squeezed her hands\
into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of\
elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance,\
saying meekly,--\
\
"I'm perfectly miserable; but if you consider me presentable, I die\
happy."\
\
"You are highly satisfactory; turn slowly round, and let me get a\
careful view." Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then\
fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, "Yes, you'll\
do; your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet _with_ the rose\
is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands\
easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's one thing you can do\
well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl--I can't; but it's very nice to see you,\
and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one; it's simple, but\
handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point\
of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to\
show my boots, for my feet _are_ pretty, though my nose isn't."\
\
"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever," said Jo, looking through\
her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the\
gold hair. "Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up,\
please, ma'am?"\
\
"Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house; the sweeping style\
suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You\
haven't half buttoned one cuff; do it at once. You'll never look\
finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make\
up the pleasing whole."\
\
Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up\
her cuff; but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as\
"pretty as picters," Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to\
watch them.\
\
"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so\
I want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make any of your abrupt\
remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and\
quiet,--that's safe and ladylike; and you can easily do it for fifteen\
minutes," said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed\
the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.\
\
"Let me see. 'Calm, cool, and quiet,'--yes, I think I can promise that.\
I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it\
off. My powers are great, as you shall see; so be easy in your mind, my\
child."\
\
Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word; for, during\
the first call, she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold\
correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snow-bank, and as\
silent as a sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her "charming\
novel," and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,\
and the fashions; each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a\
demure "Yes" or "No," with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the\
word "Talk," tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with\
her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment\
like Maud's face, "icily regular, splendidly null."\
\
"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!" was\
the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door\
closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,\
but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very\
naturally laid the blame upon Jo.\
\
"How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly\
dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and\
stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs', gossip as other girls do, and\
be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up.\
They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to know, and\
I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for anything."\
\
"I'll be agreeable; I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and\
raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I'll\
imitate what is called 'a charming girl;' I can do it, for I have May\
Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her. See if the Lambs don't\
say, 'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!'"\
\
Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there\
was no knowing where she would stop. Amy's face was a study when she saw\
her sister skim into the next drawing-room, kiss all the young ladies\
with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the\
chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession\
of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to hear a long\
account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful young\
gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush in and\
rescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed\
possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the old\
lady. A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to\
hear what was going on; for broken sentences filled her with alarm,\
round eyes and uplifted hands tormented her with curiosity, and frequent\
peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her\
suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation:--\
\
"She rides splendidly,--who taught her?"\
\
"No one; she used to practise mounting, holding the reins, and sitting\
straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she\
doesn't know what fear is, and the stable-man lets her have horses\
cheap, because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a\
passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails she can be a\
horse-breaker, and get her living so."\
\
At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the\
impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which\
was her especial aversion. But what could she do? for the old lady was\
in the middle of her story, and long before it was done Jo was off\
again, making more droll revelations, and committing still more fearful\
blunders.\
\
"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,\
and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that\
you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for\
a pleasure party, wasn't it?"\
\
"Which did she choose?" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed\
the subject.\
\
"None of them; she heard of a young horse at the farmhouse over the\
river, and, though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,\
because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really\
pathetic; there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took\
the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over\
the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter\
amazement of the old man!"\
\
            [Illustration: She took the saddle to the horse]\
\
"Did she ride the horse?"\
\
"Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her\
brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the\
life of the party."\
\
"Well, I call that plucky!" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving\
glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the\
girl look so red and uncomfortable.\
\
She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a\
sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One of\
the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to\
the picnic; and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was\
bought two years ago, must needs answer, with unnecessary frankness,\
"Oh, Amy painted it; you can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours\
any color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister."\
\
"Isn't that an original idea?" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.\
\
"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's\
nothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for\
Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest\
shade of sky-blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,"\
added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that\
exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her\
card-case at her.\
\
"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,"\
observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,\
who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.\
\
Any mention of her "works" always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either\
grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a _brusque_\
remark, as now. "Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write\
that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you\
going to New York this winter?"\
\
As Miss Lamb had "enjoyed" the story, this speech was not exactly\
grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake;\
but, fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was\
for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an\
abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their\
mouths.\
\
"Amy, we _must_ go. _Good_-by, dear; _do_ come and see us; we are\
_pining_ for a visit. I don't dare to ask _you_, Mr. Lamb; but if you\
_should_ come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away."\
\
Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style\
that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong\
desire to laugh and cry at the same time.\
\
"Didn't I do that well?" asked Jo, with a satisfied air, as they walked\
away.\
\
"Nothing could have been worse," was Amy's crushing reply. "What\
possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and\
boots, and all the rest of it?"\
\
"Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no\
use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and\
have things as easy and fine as they do."\
\
"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our\
poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper\
pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak,"\
said Amy despairingly.\
\
Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the\
stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.\
\
"How shall I behave here?" she asked, as they approached the third\
mansion.\
\
"Just as you please; I wash my hands of you," was Amy's short answer.\
\
"Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a\
comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance\
has a bad effect upon my constitution," returned Jo gruffly, being\
disturbed by her failures to suit.\
\
An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children\
speedily soothed her ruffled feelings; and, leaving Amy to entertain the\
hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted\
herself to the young folks, and found the change refreshing. She\
listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and\
poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that "Tom Brown was a brick,"\
regardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a\
visit to his turtle-tank, she went with an alacrity which caused mamma\
to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left\
in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bear-like but affectionate, and\
dearer to her than the most faultless _coiffure_ from the hands of an\
inspired Frenchwoman.\
\
Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to\
her heart's content. Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who\
was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family\
with great respect; for, in spite of her American birth and breeding,\
she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of\
us,--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set\
the most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a\
royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has\
something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that\
of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she\
could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But\
even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the\
British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time; and when the\
proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from\
this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping\
that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which\
should bring disgrace upon the name of March.\
\
                [Illustration: It might have been worse]\
\
It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the\
grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog\
reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related\
one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was\
poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating\
gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her\
gloves. But all were enjoying themselves; and when Jo collected her\
damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come\
again, "it was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks."\
\
"Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after\
that," said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from\
habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.\
\
"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?" asked Amy, wisely refraining from\
any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.\
\
"Don't like him; he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father,\
and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast,\
and _I_ don't consider him a desirable acquaintance; so I let him\
alone."\
\
"You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod; and\
just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,\
whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and\
the bow, it would have been right," said Amy reprovingly.\
\
"No, it wouldn't," returned perverse Jo; "I neither like, respect, nor\
admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece _was_\
third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very\
clever; I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he _is_ a\
gentleman in spite of the brown-paper parcels."\
\
"It's no use trying to argue with you," began Amy.\
\
"Not the least, my dear," interrupted Jo; "so let us look amiable, and\
drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply\
grateful."\
\
The family card-case having done its duty, the girls walked on, and Jo\
uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told\
that the young ladies were engaged.\
\
"Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March to-day. We can run down\
there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our\
best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross."\
\
"Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt likes to have us pay her the\
compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call; it's a little\
thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it will hurt\
your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil\
them. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet."\
\
"What a good girl you are, Amy!" said Jo, with a repentant glance from\
her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and\
spotless still. "I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to\
please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much\
time to do them; so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let\
the small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I fancy."\
\
Amy smiled, and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,--\
\
"Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones; for they\
have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd\
remember that, and practise it, you'd be better liked than I am, because\
there is more of you."\
\
"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own\
that you are right; only it's easier for me to risk my life for a person\
than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it. It's a great\
misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?"\
\
"It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying that I\
don't approve of Tudor any more than you do; but I'm not called upon to\
tell him so; neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself\
disagreeable because he is."\
\
"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men; and\
how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any\
good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddy to manage; but there\
are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I\
say we _ought_ to do it to others if we can."\
\
"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other\
boys," said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have\
convulsed the "remarkable boy," if he had heard it. "If we were belles,\
or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps; but for\
us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve of\
them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a particle\
of effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical."\
\
"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely\
because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort\
of morality."\
\
"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world; and\
people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their\
pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you will never try to be one."\
\
"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can; for in spite of the\
laughing, the world would never get on without them. We can't agree\
about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new: you will\
get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should\
rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."\
\
"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry aunt with your new ideas."\
\
"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some\
particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her; it's my\
doom, and I can't help it."\
\
They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very\
interesting subject; but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a\
conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their\
nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned; but\
Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper, and pleased\
everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was\
felt at once, and both the aunts "my deared" her affectionately, looking\
what they afterwards said emphatically,--"That child improves every\
day."\
\
"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy\
sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well\
in the young.\
\
"Yes, aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a\
table, as I have nothing but my time to give."\
\
"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly. "I hate to be patronized, and the\
Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly\
connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy: they only want you to\
work."\
\
"I am willing to work: it's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,\
and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.\
Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant."\
\
"Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear; it's a\
pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts: some do not, and\
that is trying," observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at Jo,\
who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.\
\
                [Illustration: The call at Aunt March's]\
\
If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance\
for one of them, she would have turned dovelike in a minute; but,\
unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what\
goes on in the minds of our friends; better for us that we cannot as a\
general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a\
saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of\
several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of\
holding her tongue.\
\
"I don't like favors; they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I'd\
rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent."\
\
"Ahem!" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.\
\
"I told you so," said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.\
\
Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the\
air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.\
\
"Do you speak French, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying her hand on\
Amy's.\
\
"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often\
as I like," replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old lady\
to smile affably.\
\
"How are you about languages?" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.\
\
"Don't know a word; I'm very stupid about studying anything; can't bear\
French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language," was the _brusque_\
reply.\
\
Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy, "You\
are quite strong and well, now, dear, I believe? Eyes don't trouble you\
any more, do they?"\
\
"Not at all, thank you, ma'am. I'm very well, and mean to do great\
things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that\
joyful time arrives."\
\
"Good girl! You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day," said\
Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her ball\
for her.\
\
        "Cross-patch, draw the latch,\
         Sit by the fire and spin,"\
\
squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to\
peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that\
it was impossible to help laughing.\
\
"Most observing bird," said the old lady.\
\
"Come and take a walk, my dear?" cried Polly, hopping toward the\
china-closet, with a look suggestive of lump-sugar.\
\
"Thank you, I will. Come, Amy;" and Jo brought the visit to an end,\
feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon\
her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy\
kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the\
impression of shadow and sunshine; which impression caused Aunt March to\
say, as they vanished,--\
\
"You'd better do it, Mary; I'll supply the money," and Aunt Carrol to\
reply decidedly, "I certainly will, if her father and mother consent."\

\
                             CONSEQUENCES.\
\
\
Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was\
considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be\
invited to take a table, and every one was much interested in the\
matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all\
parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life,\
and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily.\
The "haughty, uninteresting creature" was let severely alone; but Amy's\
talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art-table,\
and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable\
contributions to it.\
\
Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened; then\
there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost\
impossible to avoid, when some five and twenty women, old and young,\
with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.\
\
May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater\
favorite than herself, and, just at this time, several trifling\
circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink\
work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases,--that was one thorn; then\
the all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy, at a late\
party, and only once with May,--that was thorn number two; but the chief\
grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her\
unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered\
to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the\
blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had\
been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had\
permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits,\
however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before\
the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs.\
Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,\
said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look,--\
\
"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about\
my giving this table to any one but my girls. As this is the most\
prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are\
the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take\
this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in\
the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have\
another table if you like."\
\
Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver\
this little speech; but when the time came, she found it rather\
difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking\
straight at her, full of surprise and trouble.\
\
Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what,\
and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,--\
\
"Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"\
\
"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg; it's merely a matter\
of expediency, you see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this\
table is considered their proper place. _I_ think it very appropriate\
to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty;\
but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that\
you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower-table? The\
little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a\
charming thing of it, and the flower-table is always attractive, you\
know."\
\
"Especially to gentlemen," added May, with a look which enlightened Amy\
as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but\
took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered, with\
unexpected amiability,--\
\
"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here at\
once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."\
\
"You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer," began\
May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty\
racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully\
made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook\
her meaning, and said quickly,--\
\
"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way;" and sweeping her contributions\
into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her\
works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.\
\
"Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, mamma,"\
said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.\
\
"Girls' quarrels are soon over," returned her mother, feeling a trifle\
ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.\
\
The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which\
cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to\
work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But\
everything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; every one\
was too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls\
were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many\
magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to\
preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm\
after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her\
head when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of\
water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her\
hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draught, which last\
affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl-reader\
who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy, and\
wish her well through with her task.\
\
There was great indignation at home when she told her story that\
evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done\
right; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all; and Jo demanded\
why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to\
get on without her.\
\
"Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things,\
and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it.\
They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won't\
they, Marmee?"\
\
"That's the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best,\
though it's not very easy to give it sometimes," said her mother, with\
the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and\
practising.\
\
In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,\
Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her\
enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came\
to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table\
that morning, while the little girls were in an ante-room filling the\
baskets, she took up her pet production,--a little book, the antique\
cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which,\
on leaves of vellum, she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As\
she turned the pages, rich in dainty devices, with very pardonable\
pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed\
in a brilliant scroll-work of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little\
spirits of good-will helping one another up and down among the thorns\
and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."\
\
"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright\
page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not\
hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute,\
turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for\
all heart-burnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true\
sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street,\
school, office, or home; even a fair-table may become a pulpit, if it\
can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.\
Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and\
there; and she did what many of us do not always do,--took the sermon to\
heart, and straightway put it in practice.\
\
A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty\
things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their\
voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the\
story, and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit\
had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She\
heard May say sorrowfully,--\
\
"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't\
want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then:\
now it's spoilt."\
\
"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her," suggested some one.\
\
"How could I after all the fuss?" began May, but she did not finish, for\
Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly,--\
\
"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was\
just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table\
rather than mine. Here they are; please take them, and forgive me if I\
was hasty in carrying them away last night."\
\
As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and\
hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing\
than it was to stay and be thanked for it.\
\
"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?" cried one girl.\
\
May's answer was inaudible; but another young lady, whose temper was\
evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable\
laugh, "Very lovely; for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own\
table."\
\
Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them\
appreciated, at least; and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it,\
feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is,--as she\
presently discovered; for her spirits began to rise, and her table to\
blossom under her skilful hands; the girls were very kind, and that one\
little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.\
\
It was a very long day, and a hard one to Amy, as she sat behind her\
table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon: few\
cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long\
before night.\
\
The art-table _was_ the most attractive in the room; there was a crowd\
about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro\
with important faces and rattling money-boxes. Amy often looked\
wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy,\
instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to\
some of us; but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious,\
but very trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by\
her family, and Laurie and his friends, made it a real martyrdom.\
\
She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet\
that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no\
complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her\
an extra cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming\
little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting\
herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were\
about to be turned.\
\
"Don't do anything rude, pray, Jo. I won't have any fuss made, so let it\
all pass, and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed early,\
hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little\
table.\
\
"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I\
know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his\
boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet," returned Jo,\
leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp\
was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.\
\
"Is that my boy?"\
\
"As sure as this is my girl!" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm,\
with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.\
\
"O Teddy, such doings!" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.\
\
"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by, and I'll be\
hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down\
before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her cause with\
warmth.\
\
"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not\
arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn't\
wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean thing they are\
very likely to do another," observed Jo, in a disgusted tone.\
\
"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to."\
\
"I didn't know that; he forgot, I suppose; and, as your grandpa was\
poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some."\
\
"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking! They are\
just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in everything?"\
began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.\
\
"Gracious, I hope not! half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at\
all. But we mustn't stand philandering here; I've got to help Amy, so\
you go and make yourself splendid; and if you'll be so very kind as to\
let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you\
forever."\
\
"Couldn't you do it now?" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the\
gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars,\
"Go away, Teddy; I'm busy."\
\
Thanks to the conspirators, the tables _were_ turned that night; for\
Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket, arranged in\
his best manner, for a centre-piece; then the March family turned out\
_en masse_, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only\
came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and\
apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends\
gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,\
encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in\
the room. Amy was in her element now, and, out of gratitude, if nothing\
more, was as sprightly and gracious as possible,--coming to the\
conclusion, about that time, that virtue _was_ its own reward, after\
all.\
\
                 [Illustration: Bought up the bouquets]\
\
Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety; and when Amy was happily\
surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the hall, picking\
up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the\
Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the\
ill-feeling, and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible; she also\
discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and\
considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art-table, she\
glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no signs of them.\
"Tucked away out of sight, I dare say," thought Jo, who could forgive\
her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered to her family.\
\
"Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?" asked May, with a\
conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be\
generous.\
\
"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is\
enjoying herself. The flower-table is always attractive, you know,\
'especially to gentlemen.'"\
\
Jo _couldn't_ resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly\
she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases,\
which still remained unsold.\
\
"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for\
father," said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.\
\
"Everything of Amy's sold long ago; I took care that the right people\
saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us," returned\
May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy, that\
day.\
\
Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news; and Amy looked\
both touched and surprised by the report of May's words and manner.\
\
"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables\
as generously as you have by mine--especially the art-table," she said,\
ordering out "Teddy's Own," as the girls called the college friends.\
\
"'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table; but do your\
duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of _art_ in every sense\
of the word," said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared\
to take the field.\
\
"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," said little\
Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting\
promptly quenched by Laurie, who said, "Very well, my son, for a small\
boy!" and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.\
\
"Buy the vases," whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of\
fire on her enemy's head.\
\
To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but\
pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen\
speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and\
wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted\
fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.\
\
Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said\
something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam\
with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and\
anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till\
several days later.\
\
The fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy good night, she\
did not "gush" as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look\
which said, "Forgive and forget." That satisfied Amy; and when she got\
home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney-piece, with a\
great bouquet in each. "The reward of merit for a magnanimous March," as\
Laurie announced with a flourish.\
\
"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character\
than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I\
respect you with all my heart," said Jo warmly, as they brushed their\
hair together late that night.\
\
"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must\
have been dreadfully hard, after working so long, and setting your heart\
on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done it\
as kindly as you did," added Beth from her pillow.\
\
"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so; I only did as I'd be done by. You\
laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true\
gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know\
how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little\
meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far from\
it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what mother is."\
\
Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug,--\
\
"I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You\
are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in\
true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away,\
deary; you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more\
delighted than I shall."\
\
A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be\
delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was\
illuminated to such a degree, when she read it, that Jo and Beth, who\
were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.\
\
"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants--"\
\
"Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an\
uncontrollable rapture.\
\
"No, dear, not you; it's Amy."\
\
"O mother! she's too young; it's my turn first. I've wanted it so\
long--it would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid--I\
_must_ go."\
\
"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not\
for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."\
\
"It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't\
fair, oh, it isn't fair!" cried Jo passionately.\
\
"I'm afraid it is partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the\
other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit;\
and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said,--'I planned\
at first to ask Jo; but as "favors burden her," and she "hates French,"\
I think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a\
good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may\
give her.'"\
\
"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! why can't I learn to keep it\
quiet?" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When\
she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said\
sorrowfully,--\
\
"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time; so\
try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by reproaches\
or regrets."\
\
"I'll try," said Jo, winking hard, as she knelt down to pick up the\
basket she had joyfully upset. "I'll take a leaf out of her book, and\
try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute\
of happiness; but it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful\
disappointment;" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held\
with several very bitter tears.\
\
"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you\
are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all,\
with such a clinging touch and loving face, that Jo felt comforted in\
spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and\
humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how\
gratefully she would bear it.\
\
By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family\
jubilation; not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without\
repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received the\
news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\
and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\
such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\
visions of art than herself.\
\
"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said impressively, as\
she scraped her best palette. "It will decide my career; for if I have\
any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\
it."\
\
"Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\
collars which were to be handed over to Amy.\
\
"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living," replied the\
aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure; but she made a wry face\
at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\
vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\
\
"No, you won't; you hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and\
come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days," said Jo.\
\
"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\
will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\
should like to be able to help those who are," said Amy, smiling, as if\
the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\
drawing-teacher.\
\
"Hum!" said Jo, with a sigh; "if you wish it you'll have it, for your\
wishes are always granted--mine never."\
\
"Would you like to go?" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\
her knife.\
\
"Rather!"\
\
"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\
for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times."\
\
"Thank you; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes,\
if it ever does," returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer\
as gratefully as she could.\
\
There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment\
till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\
ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\
till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\
steamer sailed; then, just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\
suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\
and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\
lingerer, saying with a sob,--\
\
"Oh, take care of them for me; and if anything should happen--"\
\
"I will, dear, I will; and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort\
you," whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\
keep his word.\
\
So Amy sailed away to find the old world, which is always new and\
beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\
the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\
the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see\
nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.\

\
                       OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.\
\
\
                                                    "LONDON.\
    "DEAREST PEOPLE,--\
\
    "Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,\
    Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place, but uncle stopped here\
    years ago, and won't go anywhere else; however, we don't mean to\
    stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell\
    you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits\
    out of my note-book, for I've done nothing but sketch and\
    scribble since I started.\
\
    "I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but\
    after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day,\
    with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Every one was very\
    kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo; gentlemen\
    really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait\
    upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to make\
    them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I'm\
    afraid.\
\
        [Illustration: "Every one was very kind, especially the\
                         officers."--Page 378.]\
\
    "Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let\
    alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and\
    enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid\
    air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast\
    horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could\
    have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she\
    would have gone up and sat on the main-top jib, or whatever the\
    high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\
    tooted on the captain's speaking-trumpet, she'd have been in\
    such a state of rapture.\
\
    "It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and\
    found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here\
    and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's\
    country-seats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It\
    was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see\
    it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore _so_\
    picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.\
\
    "At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us,--Mr.\
    Lennox,--and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,\
    he sighed and sung, with a look at me,--\
\
        'Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?\
         She lives on the banks of Killarney;\
         From the glance of her eye,\
         Shun danger and fly,\
         For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.'\
\
    Wasn't that nonsensical?\
\
    "We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy\
    place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a\
    pair of dog-skin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an\
    umbrella, and got shaved _\'e0 la_ mutton-chop, the first thing.\
    Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton; but\
    the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little\
    bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a\
    grin, 'There yer har, sir. I've give 'em the latest Yankee\
    shine.' It amused uncle immensely. Oh, I _must_ tell you what\
    that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with\
    us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my\
    room was a lovely one, with 'Robert Lennox's compliments,' on\
    the card. Wasn't that fun, girls? I like travelling.\
\
    "I never _shall_ get to London if I don't hurry. The trip was\
    like riding through a long picture-gallery, full of lovely\
    landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight; with thatched roofs,\
    ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy\
    children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than\
    ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a\
    contented cluck, as if they never got nervous, like Yankee\
    biddies. Such perfect color I never saw,--the grass so green,\
    sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark,--I was in a rapture\
    all the way. So was Flo; and we kept bouncing from one side to\
    the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along\
    at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to\
    sleep, but uncle read his guide-book, and wouldn't be astonished\
    at anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up,--'Oh,\
    that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!' Flo,\
    darting to my window,--'How sweet! We must go there some time,\
    won't we, papa?' Uncle, calmly admiring his boots,--'No, my\
    dear, not unless you want beer; that's a brewery.'\
\
    "A pause,--then Flo cried out, 'Bless me, there's a gallows and\
    a man going up.' 'Where, where?' shrieks Amy, staring out at two\
    tall posts with a cross-beam and some dangling chains. 'A\
    colliery,' remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. 'Here's a\
    lovely flock of lambs all lying down,' says Amy. 'See, papa,\
    aren't they pretty!' added Flo sentimentally. 'Geese, young\
    ladies,' returns uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo\
    settles down to enjoy 'The Flirtations of Capt. Cavendish,' and\
    I have the scenery all to myself.\
\
    "Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was\
    nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked,\
    and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some\
    new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.\
    A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the\
    loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is\
    perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap--nice ribbons only\
    sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in\
    Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?\
\
    "Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while aunt\
    and uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned\
    afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in\
    them alone. It was so droll! for when we were shut in by the\
    wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and\
    told me to stop him. But he was up outside behind somewhere, and\
    I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap\
    my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling\
    away, and whirling around corners at a break-neck pace. At last,\
    in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it\
    open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said,--\
\
    "'Now then, mum?'\
\
    "I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the\
    door, with an 'Aye, aye, mum,' the man made his horse walk, as\
    if going to a funeral. I poked again, and said, 'A little\
    faster;' then off he went, helter-skelter, as before, and we\
    resigned ourselves to our fate.\
\
    "To-day was fair and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are\
    more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives\
    near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the\
    Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw,\
    my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers\
    rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous\
    Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and\
    powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest\
    children I ever saw; handsome girls, looking half asleep;\
    dandies, in queer English hats and lavender kids, lounging\
    about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps\
    stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\
\
    "Rotten Row means '_Route de Roi_,' or the king's way; but now\
    it's more like a riding-school than anything else. The horses\
    are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well; but\
    the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our\
    rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they\
    trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high\
    hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Every one\
    rides,--old men, stout ladies, little children,--and the young\
    folks do a deal of flirting here; I saw a pair exchange\
    rosebuds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and\
    I thought it rather a nice little idea.\
\
    "In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey; but don't expect me to\
    describe it, that's impossible--so I'll only say it was sublime!\
    This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an\
    appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.\
\
                                                          "MIDNIGHT.\
\
    "It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning\
    without telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think\
    came in, as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and\
    Frank Vaughn! I was _so_ surprised, for I shouldn't have known\
    them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows, with whiskers;\
    Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for\
    he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard\
    from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their\
    house; but uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see\
    them as we can. They went to the theatre with us, and we did\
    have _such_ a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and\
    Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we\
    had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for\
    her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when\
    I spoke of Jo, and sent his 'respectful compliments to the big\
    hat.' Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we\
    had there. What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?\
\
    "Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I _must_\
    stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing\
    here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a\
    jumble of parks, theatres, new gowns, and gallant creatures who\
    say 'Ah!' and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English\
    lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense\
    am, as ever, your loving\
                                                               AMY."\
\
\
    "DEAR GIRLS,--                                           "PARIS.\
\
    "In my last I told you about our London visit,--how kind the\
    Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I\
    enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum\
    more than anything else,--for at Hampton I saw Raphael's\
    cartoons, and, at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner,\
    Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The\
    day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English\
    picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I\
    could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We\
    'did' London to our hearts' content, thanks to Fred and Frank,\
    and were sorry to go away; for, though English people are slow\
    to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they\
    cannot be outdone in hospitality, _I_ think. The Vaughns hope to\
    meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully\
    disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I are great friends,\
    and the boys very nice fellows,--especially Fred.\
\
    "Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again,\
    saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland.\
    Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she\
    couldn't say a word; and now we get on nicely, and are very glad\
    he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't know\
    what we should do without him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and\
    insists on talking English very loud, as if that would make\
    people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned,\
    and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good\
    deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do the\
    '_parley vooing_,' as uncle calls it.\
\
    "Such delightful times as we are having! sight-seeing from\
    morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay\
    _caf\'e9s_, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy\
    days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn\
    up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no\
    soul for art; but _I_ have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as\
    fast as I can. She would like the relics of great people better,\
    for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat, his\
    baby's cradle and his old toothbrush; also Marie Antoinette's\
    little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword, and\
    many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about them\
    when I come, but haven't time to write.\
\
    "The Palais Royale is a heavenly place,--so full of _bijouterie_\
    and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy\
    them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow\
    it. Then the Bois and the Champs Elys\'e9es are _tr\'e8s magnifique_.\
    I've seen the imperial family several times,--the emperor an\
    ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed\
    in bad taste, _I_ thought,--purple dress, green hat, and yellow\
    gloves. Little Nap. is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his\
    tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his\
    four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets, and a\
    mounted guard before and behind.\
\
      [Illustration: I've seen the imperial family several times]\
\
    "We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely,\
    though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. P\'e8re la\
    Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small\
    rooms, and, looking in, one sees a table, with images or\
    pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in\
    when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.\
\
    "Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and, sitting in the\
    balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It is\
    so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there, when too\
    tired with our day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining,\
    and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever\
    knew,--except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish\
    Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men; however, the Vaughns\
    are very rich, and come of an excellent family, so I won't find\
    fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.\
\
    "Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland; and, as we\
    shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty\
    letters. I keep my diary, and try to 'remember correctly and\
    describe clearly all that I see and admire,' as father advised.\
    It is good practice for me, and, with my sketch-book, will give\
    you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.\
\
    "Adieu; I embrace you tenderly.                     VOTRE AMIE."\
\
\
    "MY DEAR MAMMA,--                                   "HEIDELBERG.\
\
    "Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell\
    you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you\
    will see.\
\
    "The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed\
    it with all my might. Get father's old guide-books, and read\
    about it; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At\
    Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with\
    whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was\
    a moonlight night, and, about one o'clock, Flo and I were waked\
    by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and\
    hid behind the curtains; but sly peeps showed us Fred and the\
    students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing\
    I ever saw,--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress\
    opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of\
    stone.\
\
    "When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them\
    scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and\
    go laughing away,--to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next\
    morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his\
    vest-pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and\
    said I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him,\
    for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.\
    I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to\
    look like it.\
\
    "The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where\
    Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He needs some one to\
    look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she\
    hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would\
    be well for him. Frankfort was delightful; I saw Goethe's house,\
    Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous 'Ariadne.' It was very\
    lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the\
    story better. I didn't like to ask, as every one knew it, or\
    pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it; I\
    ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything, and\
    it mortifies me.\
\
    "Now comes the serious part,--for it happened here, and Fred is\
    just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite\
    fond of him; I never thought of anything but a travelling\
    friendship, till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to\
    feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily\
    adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't\
    flirted, mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and\
    have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I\
    don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for\
    them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know mother\
    will shake her head, and the girls say, 'Oh, the mercenary\
    little wretch!' but I've made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me,\
    I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him,\
    and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young,\
    clever enough, and very rich,--ever so much richer than the\
    Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should\
    be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\
    people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have\
    the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city\
    house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses,\
    but twice as comfortable, and full of solid luxury, such as\
    English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've\
    seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and\
    pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,\
    lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should\
    ask! and I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up\
    so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I\
    hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I\
    can help. One of us _must_ marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't,\
    Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything cosey all round.\
    I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of\
    that; and, though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well,\
    and, in time, I should get fond enough of him if he was very\
    fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning\
    the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible\
    to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little\
    things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side\
    of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\
    are alone, and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to\
    me. Yesterday, at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us,\
    and then said something to his friend,--a rakish-looking\
    baron,--about '_ein wondersch\'f6nes Bl\'f6ndchen_,' Fred looked as\
    fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely, it nearly flew\
    off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but\
    is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might\
    guess from his bonnie blue eyes.\
\
    "Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset,--at\
    least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there, after going\
    to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking\
    about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the\
    beautiful gardens made by the elector, long ago, for his English\
    wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine;\
    so, while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there\
    trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with\
    scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got\
    into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling\
    through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band\
    below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I\
    had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was\
    ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool,\
    and only a little excited.\
\
[Illustration: Trying to sketch the gray-stone lion's head on the wall]\
\
    "By and by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying\
    through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I\
    forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said\
    he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was\
    very ill; so he was going at once, in the night train, and only\
    had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and\
    disappointed for myself, but only for a minute, because he\
    said, as he shook hands,--and said it in a way that I could not\
    mistake,--'I shall soon come back; you won't forget me, Amy?'\
\
    "I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied,\
    and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes,\
    for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know\
    he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted,\
    that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort\
    yet awhile, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a\
    foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome; and then,\
    if I don't change my mind, I'll say 'Yes, thank you,' when he\
    says 'Will you, please?'\
\
    "Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know\
    what was going on. Don't be anxious about me; remember I am your\
    'prudent Amy,' and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as\
    much advice as you like; I'll use it if I can. I wish I could\
    see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust me.\
\
                                    "Ever your                 AMY."\

\
                            TENDER TROUBLES.\
\
\
"Jo, I'm anxious about Beth."\
\
"Why, mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came."\
\
"It's not her health that troubles me now; it's her spirits. I'm sure\
there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is."\
\
"What makes you think so, mother?"\
\
"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as\
she used. I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she\
sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in\
her face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries\
me."\
\
"Have you asked her about it?"\
\
"I have tried once or twice; but she either evaded my questions, or\
looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's\
confidence, and I seldom have to wait for it long."\
\
Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\
quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's; and, after\
sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said,--\
\
"I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have\
hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why, or being able to\
explain them. Why, mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and\
treat her like a child, forgetting she's a woman."\
\
"So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up," returned her mother,\
with a sigh and a smile.\
\
"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of\
worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise\
never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you."\
\
"It is a great comfort, Jo; I always feel strong when you are at home,\
now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon;\
but when the tug comes, you are always ready."\
\
"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be one\
scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works, and I'm not; but I\
feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half the\
family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad; but if\
anything is amiss at home, I'm your man."\
\
"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little\
heart to her Jo sooner than to any one else. Be very kind, and don't let\
her think any one watches or talks about her. If she only would get\
quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world."\
\
"Happy woman! I've got heaps."\
\
"My dear, what are they?"\
\
"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They are not\
very wearing, so they'll keep;" and Jo stitched away, with a wise nod\
which set her mother's heart at rest about her, for the present at\
least.\
\
While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth; and,\
after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which\
seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue\
to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the\
rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she\
and Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on\
her sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's\
work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand,\
in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal\
landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic\
blackbird, and a voice called out,--\
\
           [Illustration: She leaned her head upon her hands]\
\
"All serene! Coming in to-night."\
\
Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\
till his quick tramp died away, then said softly, as if to herself,--\
\
"How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks."\
\
"Hum!" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face; for the bright\
color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a\
tear lay shining on the window-ledge. Beth whisked it off, and glanced\
apprehensively at Jo; but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate,\
apparently engrossed in "Olympia's Oath." The instant Beth turned, Jo\
began her watch again, saw Beth's hand go quietly to her eyes more than\
once, and, in her half-averted face, read a tender sorrow that made her\
own eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring\
something about needing more paper.\
\
"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!" she said, sitting down in her own\
room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\
just made. "I never dreamt of such a thing. What _will_ mother say? I\
wonder if he--" there Jo stopped, and turned scarlet with a sudden\
thought. "If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be. He\
must; I'll make him!" and she shook her head threateningly at the\
picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\
"Oh dear, we _are_ growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a\
mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one\
that has sense enough to keep out of mischief." Jo thought intently for\
a minute, with her eyes fixed on the picture; then she smoothed out her\
wrinkled forehead, and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite,\
"No, thank you, sir; you're very charming, but you've no more stability\
than a weathercock; so you needn't write touching notes, and smile in\
that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have\
it."\
\
Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie, from which she did not wake\
till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\
only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\
with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\
but so was everybody's; therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\
cared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had\
prevailed in the family, of late, that "our boy" was getting fonder than\
ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject, and\
scolded violently if any one dared to suggest it. If they had known the\
various tender passages of the past year, or rather attempts at tender\
passages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the\
immense satisfaction of saying, "I told you so." But Jo hated\
"philandering," and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile\
ready at the least sign of impending danger.\
\
When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month;\
but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\
amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair,\
and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\
conferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many\
shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\
occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender\
subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\
and gave out that he was going to "dig," intending to graduate in a\
blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight\
confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\
eye; for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\
imaginary heroes to real ones, because, when tired of them, the former\
could be shut up in the tin-kitchen till called for, and the latter were\
less manageable.\
\
Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo\
watched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she had not\
got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\
the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But\
having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\
a great pace; and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\
of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual, Beth lay on\
the sofa, and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\
sorts of gossip; for she depended on her weekly "spin," and he never\
disappointed her. But that evening, Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\
on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she\
listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\
cricket-match, though the phrases, "caught off a tice," "stumped off his\
ground," and "the leg hit for three," were as intelligible to her as\
Sanscrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that\
she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he\
dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little\
absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity\
that was really almost tender.\
\
"Who knows? stranger things have happened," thought Jo, as she fussed\
about the room. "She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\
life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each\
other. I don't see how he can help it; and I do believe he would if the\
rest of us were out of the way."\
\
As every one _was_ out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that\
she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go?\
and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat\
down to settle that point.\
\
Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa,--long, broad,\
well-cushioned, and low; a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\
girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode\
on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired\
heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women.\
They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always\
been Jo's favorite lounging-place. Among the many pillows that adorned\
the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly\
horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end; this\
repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of\
defence, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.\
\
Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep\
aversion, having been unmercifully pummelled with it in former days,\
when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from taking\
the seat he most coveted, next to Jo in the sofa corner. If "the\
sausage" as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might\
approach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to the man,\
woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to\
barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before\
a massive form appeared beside her, and, with both arms spread over the\
sofa-back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed,\
with a sigh of satisfaction,--\
\
"Now, _this_ is filling at the price."\
\
           [Illustration: Now, this is filling at the price]\
\
"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late,\
there was no room for it; and, coasting on to the floor, it disappeared\
in a most mysterious manner.\
\
"Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all the\
week, a fellow deserves petting, and ought to get it."\
\
"Beth will pet you; I'm busy."\
\
"No, she's not to be bothered with me; but you like that sort of thing,\
unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate\
your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"\
\
Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,\
but Jo quenched "her boy" by turning on him with the stern query,--\
\
"How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"\
\
"Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then."\
\
"I'm glad of it; that's one of your foolish extravagances,--sending\
flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two pins," continued\
Jo reprovingly.\
\
"Sensible girls, for whom I do care whole papers of pins, won't let me\
send them 'flowers and things,' so what can I do? My feelings must have\
a _went_."\
\
"Mother doesn't approve of flirting, even in fun; and you do flirt\
desperately, Teddy."\
\
"I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you.' As I can't, I'll\
merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little game, if\
all parties understand that it's only play."\
\
"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've\
tried, because one feels awkward in company, not to do as everybody else\
is doing; but I don't seem to get on," said Jo, forgetting to play\
Mentor.\
\
"Take lessons of Amy; she has a regular talent for it."\
\
"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I\
suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and others\
to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place."\
\
"I'm glad you can't flirt; it's really refreshing to see a sensible,\
straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of\
herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do go on\
at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm sure;\
but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend\
their ways, I fancy."\
\
"They do the same; and, as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows\
get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. If you\
behaved properly, they would; but, knowing you like their nonsense, they\
keep it up, and then you blame them."\
\
"Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie, in a superior tone. "We\
don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.\
The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,\
among gentlemen. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place\
for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my\
word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say\
with our friend Cock Robin,--\
\
        "'Out upon you, fie upon you,\
           Bold-faced jig!'"\
\
It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between\
Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very\
natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society\
showed him many samples. Jo knew that "young Laurence" was regarded as a\
most eligible _parti_ by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their\
daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\
of him; so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoilt,\
and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in\
modest girls. Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said,\
dropping her voice, "If you _must_ have a 'went,' Teddy, go and devote\
yourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do respect, and\
not waste your time with the silly ones."\
\
"You really advise it?" and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of\
anxiety and merriment in his face.\
\
"Yes, I do; but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the\
whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You're not half\
good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl maybe," and Jo looked a\
little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.\
\
"That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite\
new to him, as he dropped his eyes, and absently wound Jo's apron-tassel\
round his finger.\
\
"Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo; adding aloud, "Go and\
sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always like yours."\
\
"I'd rather stay here, thank you."\
\
"Well, you can't; there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful, since\
you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a\
woman's apron-string?" retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of\
his own.\
\
"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie gave an audacious\
tweak at the tassel.\
\
"Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.\
\
He fled at once, and the minute it was well "Up with the bonnets of\
bonnie Dundee," she slipped away, to return no more till the young\
gentleman had departed in high dudgeon.\
\
          [Illustration: Up with the Bonnets of Bonnie Dundee]\
\
Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound\
of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside, with the anxious\
inquiry, "What is it, dear?"\
\
"I thought you were asleep," sobbed Beth.\
\
"Is it the old pain, my precious?"\
\
"No; it's a new one; but I can bear it," and Beth tried to check her\
tears.\
\
"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other."\
\
"You can't; there is no cure." There Beth's voice gave way, and,\
clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was\
frightened.\
\
"Where is it? Shall I call mother?"\
\
Beth did not answer the first question; but in the dark one hand went\
involuntarily to her heart, as if the pain were there; with the other\
she held Jo fast, whispering eagerly, "No, no, don't call her, don't\
tell her. I shall be better soon. Lie down here and 'poor' my head. I'll\
be quiet, and go to sleep; indeed I will."\
\
Jo obeyed; but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot\
forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full, and she longed to\
speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,\
cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally; so, though she\
believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her\
tenderest tone, "Does anything trouble you, deary?"\
\
"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.\
\
"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"\
\
"Not now, not yet."\
\
"Then I won't ask; but remember, Bethy, that mother and Jo are always\
glad to hear and help you, if they can."\
\
"I know it. I'll tell you by and by."\
\
"Is the pain better now?"\
\
"Oh, yes, much better; you are so comfortable, Jo!"\
\
"Go to sleep, dear; I'll stay with you."\
\
So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite\
herself again; for at eighteen, neither heads nor hearts ache long, and\
a loving word can medicine most ills.\
\
But Jo had made up her mind, and, after pondering over a project for\
some days, she confided it to her mother.\
\
"You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you one of\
them, Marmee," she began, as they sat alone together. "I want to go away\
somewhere this winter for a change."\
\
"Why, Jo?" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a\
double meaning.\
\
With her eyes on her work, Jo answered soberly, "I want something new; I\
feel restless, and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than I\
am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring up,\
so, as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way, and\
try my wings."\
\
"Where will you hop?"\
\
"To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know\
Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her\
children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think I\
should suit if I tried."\
\
"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding-house!" and Mrs.\
March looked surprised, but not displeased.\
\
"It's not exactly going out to service; for Mrs. Kirke is your\
friend,--the kindest soul that ever lived,--and would make things\
pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no\
one knows me there. Don't care if they do; it's honest work, and I'm not\
ashamed of it."\
\
"Nor I; but your writing?"\
\
"All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new\
ideas, and, even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home\
quantities of material for my rubbish."\
\
"I have no doubt of it; but are these your only reasons for this sudden\
fancy?"\
\
"No, mother."\
\
"May I know the others?"\
\
Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in\
her cheeks, "It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm afraid--Laurie\
is getting too fond of me."\
\
"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care\
for you?" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.\
\
"Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely\
proud of him; but as for anything more, it's out of the question."\
\
"I'm glad of that, Jo."\
\
"Why, please?"\
\
"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As friends you\
are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over; but I fear\
you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike\
and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to\
get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and\
forbearance, as well as love."\
\
"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad\
you think he is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly\
to make him unhappy; for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old\
fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?"\
\
"You are sure of his feeling for you?"\
\
The color deepened in Jo's cheeks, as she answered, with the look of\
mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking\
of first lovers,--\
\
"I'm afraid it is so, mother; he hasn't said anything, but he looks a\
great deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to anything."\
\
"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go."\
\
Jo looked relieved, and, after a pause, said, smiling, "How Mrs. Moffat\
would wonder at your want of management, if she knew; and how she will\
rejoice that Annie still may hope."\
\
"Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the\
same in all,--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I\
am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you\
tire of it; for only then will you find that there is something sweeter.\
Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I\
indulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems\
brighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her?"\
\
"Yes; she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by and by. I\
said no more, for I think I know it;" and Jo told her little story.\
\
Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the\
case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that, for Laurie's\
sake, Jo should go away for a time.\
\
"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled; then I'll\
run away before he can collect his wits and be tragical. Beth must think\
I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to\
her; but she can pet and comfort him after I'm gone, and so cure him of\
this romantic notion. He's been through so many little trials of the\
sort, he's used to it, and will soon get over his love-lornity."\
\
Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear\
that this "little trial" would be harder than the others, and that\
Laurie would not get over his "love-lornity" as easily as heretofore.\
\
The plan was talked over in a family council, and agreed upon; for Mrs.\
Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.\
The teaching would render her independent; and such leisure as she got\
might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society\
would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was eager\
to be gone, for the home-nest was growing too narrow for her restless\
nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and\
trembling she told Laurie; but to her surprise he took it very quietly.\
He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant; and, when\
jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, "So I\
am; and I mean this one shall stay turned."\
\
Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on\
just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart,--for Beth\
seemed more cheerful,--and hoped she was doing the best for all.\
\
"One thing I leave to your especial care," she said, the night before\
she left.\
\
"You mean your papers?" asked Beth.\
\
"No, my boy. Be very good to him, won't you?"\
\
"Of course I will; but I can't fill your place, and he'll miss you\
sadly."\
\
"It won't hurt him; so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague,\
pet, and keep in order."\
\
"I'll do my best, for your sake," promised Beth, wondering why Jo looked\
at her so queerly.\
\
When Laurie said "Good-by," he whispered significantly, "It won't do a\
bit of good, Jo. My eye is on you; so mind what you do, or I'll come and\
bring you home."\

\
                             JO'S JOURNAL.\
\
\
                                                "NEW YORK, November.\
\
    "DEAR MARMEE AND BETH,--\
\
    "I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to\
    tell, though I'm not a fine young lady travelling on the\
    continent. When I lost sight of father's dear old face, I felt a\
    trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an\
    Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,\
    hadn't diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping\
    gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their\
    mouths to roar.\
\
    "Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared\
    up likewise, and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.\
\
    "Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even\
    in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little\
    sky-parlor--all she had; but there is a stove in it, and a nice\
    table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I\
    like. A fine view and a church-tower opposite atone for the many\
    stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery,\
    where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs.\
    Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty\
    children,--rather spoilt, I fancy, but they took to me after\
    telling them 'The Seven Bad Pigs;' and I've no doubt I shall\
    make a model governess.\
\
    "I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the\
    great table, and for the present I do, for I _am_ bashful,\
    though no one will believe it.\
\
    "'Now, my dear, make yourself at home,' said Mrs. K. in her\
    motherly way; 'I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you\
    may suppose with such a family; but a great anxiety will be off\
    my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are\
    always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I\
    can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you\
    feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if\
    anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the\
    tea-bell; I must run and change my cap;' and off she bustled,\
    leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.\
\
    "As I went downstairs, soon after, I saw something I liked. The\
    flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting\
    at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber\
    up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod\
    of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at\
    a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a\
    foreign accent,--\
\
    "'It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such\
    heaviness.'\
\
    "Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for, as father says,\
    trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that\
    evening, she laughed, and said,--\
\
    "'That must have been Professor Bhaer; he's always doing things\
    of that sort.'\
\
    "Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin; very learned and good, but\
    poor as a church-mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and\
    two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according\
    to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very\
    romantic story, but it interested me; and I was glad to hear\
    that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.\
    There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to\
    peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost\
    forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.\
\
    "After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I\
    attacked the big work-basket, and had a quiet evening chatting\
    with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it\
    once a week; so good-night, and more to-morrow."\
\
                                                     "_Tuesday Eve._\
\
    "Had a lively time in my seminary, this morning, for the\
    children acted like Sancho; and at one time I really thought I\
    should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try\
    gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and\
    keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk,\
    and I went to my needle-work, like little Mabel, 'with a willing\
    mind.' I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice\
    button-holes, when the parlor-door opened and shut, and some one\
    began to hum,--\
\
                         'Kennst du das land,'\
\
    like a big bumble-bee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I\
    couldn't resist the temptation; and lifting one end of the\
    curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was\
    there; and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at\
    him. A regular German,--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled\
    all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I\
    ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good,\
    after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were\
    rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome\
    feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked\
    him, for he had a fine head; his linen was very nice, and he\
    looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat,\
    and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of\
    his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth\
    bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like\
    an old friend. Then he smiled; and when a tap came at the door,\
    called out in a loud, brisk tone,--\
\
    "'Herein!'\
\
    "I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a\
    child carrying a big book, and stopped to see what was going on.\
\
    "'Me wants my Bhaer,' said the mite, slamming down her book, and\
    running to meet him.\
\
    "'Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer; come, then, and take a goot hug from\
    him, my Tina,' said the Professor, catching her up, with a\
    laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to\
    stoop her little face to kiss him.\
\
                [Illustration: Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer]\
\
    "'Now me mus tuddy my lessin,' went on the funny little thing;\
    so he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she\
    had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled\
    away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat\
    finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I\
    nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood\
    stroking her pretty hair, with a fatherly look, that made me\
    think she must be his own, though she looked more French than\
    German.\
\
    "Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me\
    back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the\
    noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept\
    laughing affectedly, and saying 'Now Professor,' in a\
    coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an\
    accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.\
\
    "Both seemed to try his patience sorely; for more than once I\
    heard him say emphatically, 'No, no, it is _not_ so; you haf not\
    attend to what I say;' and once there was a loud rap, as if he\
    struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing\
    exclamation, 'Prut! it all goes bad this day.'\
\
    "Poor man, I pitied him; and when the girls were gone, took just\
    one more peep, to see if he survived it. He seemed to have\
    thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with\
    his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put\
    his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and,\
    taking little Tina, who had fallen asleep on the sofa, in his\
    arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of\
    it.\
\
    "Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock\
    dinner; and, feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,\
    just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.\
    So I made myself respectable, and tried to slip in behind Mrs.\
    Kirke; but as she is short, and I'm tall, my efforts at\
    concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her,\
    and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage, and looked\
    about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on\
    getting their dinner,--the gentlemen especially, who seemed to\
    be eating on time, for they _bolted_ in every sense of the word,\
    vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual\
    assortment of young men absorbed in themselves; young couples\
    absorbed in each other; married ladies in their babies, and old\
    gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much\
    to do with any of them, except one sweet-faced maiden lady, who\
    looks as if she had something in her.\
\
    "Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor,\
    shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf\
    old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a\
    Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she'd have turned\
    her back on him forever, because, sad to relate, he had a great\
    appetite, and shovelled in his dinner in a manner which would\
    have horrified 'her ladyship.' I didn't mind, for I like 'to see\
    folks eat with a relish,' as Hannah says, and the poor man must\
    have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.\
\
    "As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were\
    settling their hats before the hall-mirror, and I heard one say\
    low to the other, 'Who's the new party?'\
\
    "'Governess, or something of that sort.'\
\
    "'What the deuce is she at our table for?'\
\
    "'Friend of the old lady's.'\
\
    "'Handsome head, but no style.'\
\
    "'Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.'\
\
    "I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess\
    is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style,\
    which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of\
    the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad\
    chimneys. I hate ordinary people!"\
\
                                                        "_Thursday._\
\
    "Yesterday was a quiet day, spent in teaching, sewing, and\
    writing in my little room, which is very cosey, with a light and\
    fire. I picked up a few bits of news, and was introduced to the\
    Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman\
    who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing\
    has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house\
    like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is\
    very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore.' Kitty and Minnie\
    Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of\
    stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and\
    the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems,\
    call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner\
    of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. K. says,\
    and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him, in spite\
    of his foreign ways.\
\
    "The maiden lady is a Miss Norton,--rich, cultivated, and kind.\
    She spoke to me at dinner to-day (for I went to table again,\
    it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her\
    at her room. She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting\
    persons, and seems friendly; so I shall make myself agreeable,\
    for I _do_ want to get into good society, only it isn't the same\
    sort that Amy likes.\
\
    "I was in our parlor last evening, when Mr. Bhaer came in with\
    some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie,\
    who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: 'This is\
    mamma's friend, Miss March.'\
\
    "'Yes; and she's jolly and we like her lots,' added Kitty, who\
    is an _enfant terrible_.\
\
    "We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction\
    and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.\
\
    "'Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.\
    If so again, call at me and I come,' he said, with a threatening\
    frown that delighted the little wretches.\
\
    "I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was\
    doomed to see a good deal of him, for to-day, as I passed his\
    door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my\
    umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown,\
    with a big blue sock on one hand, and a darning-needle in the\
    other; he didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained\
    and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his\
    loud, cheerful way,--\
\
            [Illustration: He waved his hand, sock and all]\
\
    "'You haf a fine day to make your walk. _Bon voyage,\
    mademoiselle._'\
\
    "I laughed all the way downstairs; but it was a little pathetic,\
    also, to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.\
    The German gentlemen embroider, I know; but darning hose is\
    another thing, and not so pretty."\
\
                                                        "_Saturday._\
\
    "Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss\
    Norton, who has a room full of lovely things, and who was very\
    charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I\
    would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her\
    escort,--if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure\
    Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of\
    kindness to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from\
    such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.\
\
    "When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the\
    parlor that I looked in; and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his\
    hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a\
    jump-rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seed-cakes, as\
    they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.\
\
    "'We are playing _nargerie_,' explained Kitty.\
\
    "'Dis is mine effalunt!' added Tina, holding on by the\
    Professor's hair.\
\
                  [Illustration: Dis is mine effalunt]\
\
    "'Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon,\
    when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?' said\
    Minnie.\
\
    "The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of\
    them, and said soberly to me,--\
\
    "'I gif you my wort it is so. If we make too large a noise you\
    shall say "Hush!" to us, and we go more softly.'\
\
    "I promised to do so, but left the door open, and enjoyed the\
    fun as much as they did,--for a more glorious frolic I never\
    witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sung, and\
    when it began to grow dark they all piled on to the sofa about\
    the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the\
    storks on the chimney-tops, and the little 'kobolds,' who ride\
    the snow-flakes as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple\
    and natural as Germans, don't you?\
\
    "I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if\
    motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin\
    paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this\
    long letter will need. Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can\
    spare them. My small news will sound very flat after her\
    splendors, but you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so\
    hard that he can't find time to write to his friends? Take good\
    care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and\
    give heaps of love to every one.\

    but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had\
    nothing else to write about. Bless you!"\

\
    "MY PRECIOUS BETSEY,--\
\
    "As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to\
    you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings\
    on; for, though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh,\
    be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the\
    way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to\
    shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not\
    so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by\
    them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little\
    lads, quite after my own heart; for the mixture of German and\
    American spirit in them produces a constant state of\
    effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether\
    spent in the house or out; for on pleasant days they all go to\
    walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep\
    order; and then such fun!\
\
    "We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I\
    really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll\
    way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke\
    called to me, one day, as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room, where she\
    was rummaging.\
\
    "'Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me\
    put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside\
    down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new\
    handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.'\
\
    "I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was 'a\
    den,' to be sure. Books and papers everywhere; a broken\
    meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done\
    with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one\
    window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;\
    half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\
    manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;\
    and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave\
    of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand\
    rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the\
    bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having\
    been used as a holder.\
\
    "'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the\
    relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig\
    ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,\
    but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,\
    he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his\
    washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I\
    forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'\
\
    "'Let me mend them,' said I. 'I don't mind it, and he needn't\
    know. I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters\
    and lending books.'\
\
    "So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two\
    pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his\
    queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it\
    out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the\
    lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much\
    that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving\
    the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this\
    door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what\
    he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had\
    gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was\
    busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\
    absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was\
    Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to\
    Tina not to betray him.\
\
    "'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep\
    at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not\
    pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'\
\
    "'Yes; but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,' I\
    blundered out, as red as a peony.\
\
    "'Prut! we will make the time, and we fail not to find the\
    sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much\
    gladness; for, look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay,'\
    and he pointed to my work. 'Yes, they say to one another, these\
    so kind ladies, "he is a stupid old fellow; he will see not what\
    we do; he will never opserve that his sock-heels go not in holes\
    any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,\
    and believe that strings make theirselves." Ah! but I haf an\
    eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel the thanks for\
    this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or no more good fairy\
    works for me and mine.'\
\
    "Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really\
    is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I\
    took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.\
    The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been\
    torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an\
    expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether\
    to laugh or cry. I tried both ways; and when it came to a sniff\
    of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to\
    the floor, and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced\
    and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was\
    scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and\
    shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if\
    I'd covered myself with glory.\
\
    "'Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant\
    little M\'e4rchen together, and dig no more in that dry book, that\
    goes in the corner for making us trouble.'\
\
    "He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersen's fairy tales so\
    invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and\
    went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to\
    amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away\
    (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over\
    long words, pronouncing according to the inspiration of the\
    minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first\
    page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried\
    out, in his hearty way, 'Das ist gute! Now we go well! My turn.\
    I do him in German; gif me your ear.' And away he went, rumbling\
    out the words with his strong voice, and a relish which was good\
    to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was the 'Constant\
    Tin Soldier,' which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,--and I\
    did,--though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't\
    help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so\
    comical.\
\
    "After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty\
    well; for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the\
    grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills\
    in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it\
    yet,--which is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to give him\
    something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me\
    something nice, Marmee.\
\
    "I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up\
    smoking, and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better\
    than I did. I'm not jealous, dear; do your best, only don't make\
    a saint of him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice\
    of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven't\
    time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven\
    Beth continues so comfortable."\
\
\
                                                           "JANUARY.\
\
    "A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course\
    includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't\
    tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't\
    get it till night, and had given up hoping. Your letter came in\
    the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it\
    for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of a\
    feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my\
    mind, as I sat up in my room, after tea; and when the big,\
    muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged\
    it, and pranced. It was so _homey_ and refreshing, that I sat\
    down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and\
    cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I\
    wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought.\
    Beth's new 'ink-bib' was capital; and Hannah's box of hard\
    gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice\
    flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books father\
    has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!\
\
 [Illustration: I sat down upon the floor and read and looked and ate]\
\
    "Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that\
    line for, on New Year's Day, Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine\
    Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I've often admired\
    it, set up in the place of honor, with his German Bible, Plato,\
    Homer, and Milton; so you may imagine how I felt when he\
    brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my name in\
    it, 'from my friend Friedrich Bhaer.'\
\
    "'You say often you wish a library: here I gif you one; for\
    between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read\
    him well, and he will help you much; for the study of character\
    in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it\
    with your pen.'\
\
    "I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about 'my\
    library,' as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much\
    there was in Shakespeare before; but then I never had a Bhaer to\
    explain it to me. Now _don't_ laugh at his horrid name; it isn't\
    pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people _will_ say it, but\
    something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I'm glad\
    you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you will know\
    him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, father his\
    wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new 'friend\
    Friedrich Bhaer.'\
\
    "Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got several\
    little things, and put them about the room, where he would find\
    them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny,--a new\
    standish on his table, a little vase for his flower,--he always\
    has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he\
    says,--and a holder for his blower, so that he needn't burn up\
    what Amy calls 'mouchoirs.' I made it like those Beth\
    invented,--a big butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow\
    wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy\
    immensely, and he put it on his mantel-piece as an article of\
    _vertu_; so it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he\
    didn't forget a servant or a child in the house; and not a soul\
    here, from the French laundry-woman to Miss Norton, forgot him.\
    I was so glad of that.\
\
    "They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I\
    didn't mean to go down, having no dress; but at the last minute,\
    Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me\
    lace and feathers; so I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed\
    in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and\
    no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think\
    I am very stiff and cool, most of them; and so I am to\
    whipper-snappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a\
    'nice derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of\
    the Nile.' I enjoyed it very much; and when we unmasked, it was\
    fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell\
    another that he knew I'd been an actress; in fact, he thought he\
    remembered seeing me at one of the minor theatres. Meg will\
    relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was\
    Titania,--a perfect little fairy in his arms. To see them dance\
    was 'quite a landscape,' to use a Teddyism.\
\
    "I had a very happy New Year, after all; and when I thought it\
    over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite\
    of my many failures; for I'm cheerful all the time now, work\
    with a will, and take more interest in other people than I used\
    to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your loving\
\

\
                               A FRIEND.\
\
\
Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with\
the daily work that earned her bread, and made it sweeter for the\
effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose which now\
took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl;\
but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. She saw that\
money conferred power: money and power, therefore, she resolved to have;\
not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved more than\
self.\
\
The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything she\
wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom; going\
abroad herself, and always having _more_ than enough, so that she might\
indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo's most cherished\
castle in the air.\
\
The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after\
long travelling and much up-hill work lead to this delightful _ch\'e2teau\
en Espagne_. But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for\
public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on\
bigger bean-stalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed\
awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble, and the\
least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the\
"up again and take another" spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack; so\
she scrambled up, on the shady side this time, and got more booty, but\
nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the money-bags.\
\
She took to writing sensation stories; for in those dark ages, even\
all-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a\
"thrilling tale," and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\
of the "Weekly Volcano." She had never read "Sartor Resartus," but she\
had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful\
over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she\
dressed herself in her best, and, trying to persuade herself that she\
was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\
dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of\
cigar-smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their\
heels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of\
them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by\
this reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\
embarrassment,--\
\
"Excuse me, I was looking for the 'Weekly Volcano' office; I wished to\
see Mr. Dashwood."\
\
Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,\
and, carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced,\
with a nod, and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling\
that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\
manuscript, and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\
blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\
occasion.\
\
"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an\
experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this\
suits."\
\
While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\
and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and\
casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\
\
"Not a first attempt, I take it?" observing that the pages were\
numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon,--sure\
sign of a novice.\
\
"No, sir; she has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the\
'Blarneystone Banner.'"\
\
"Oh, did she?" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\
take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the\
buttons on her boots. "Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've more\
of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present;\
but I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week."\
\
Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\
all; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\
bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\
apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both; for it was\
perfectly evident, from the knowing glances exchanged among the\
gentlemen, that her little fiction of "my friend" was considered a good\
joke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\
he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to\
return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\
pinafores vigorously; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\
over the scene, and long for next week.\
\
When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr.\
Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable; and Mr.\
Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners:\
so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.\
\
"We'll take this" (editors never say I), "if you don't object to a few\
alterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've marked will\
make it just the right length," he said, in a business-like tone.\
\
Jo hardly knew her own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored were its\
pages and paragraphs; but, feeling as a tender parent might on being\
asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new\
cradle, she looked at the marked passages, and was surprised to find\
that all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as\
ballast for much romance--had been stricken out.\
\
"But, sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I\
took care to have a few of my sinners repent."\
\
Mr. Dashwood's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had\
forgotten her "friend," and spoken as only an author could.\
\
"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don't sell\
nowadays;" which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.\
\
"You think it would do with these alterations, then?"\
\
"Yes; it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so\
on," was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.\
\
"What do you--that is, what compensation--" began Jo, not exactly\
knowing how to express herself.\
\
"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this\
sort. Pay when it comes out," returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point\
had escaped him; such trifles often do escape the editorial mind, it is\
said.\
\
"Very well; you can have it," said Jo, handing back the story, with a\
satisfied air; for, after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five\
seemed good pay.\
\
"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than\
this?" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and\
emboldened by her success.\
\
"Well, we'll look at it; can't promise to take it. Tell her to make it\
short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would your friend\
like to put to it?" in a careless tone.\
\
"None at all, if you please; she doesn't wish her name to appear, and\
has no _nom de plume_," said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.\
\
"Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week; will you\
call for the money, or shall I send it?" asked Mr. Dashwood, who felt a\
natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.\
\
"I'll call. Good morning, sir."\
\
As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful remark,\
"Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do."\
\
Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her\
model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational\
literature; but, thanks to the life-preserver thrown her by a friend,\
she came up again, not much the worse for her ducking.\
\
Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and\
scenery; and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared\
upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit\
as could be expected. Her readers were not particular about such trifles\
as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously\
permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it\
necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the\
fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely\
left him in the lurch.\
\
She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\
stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains\
next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing\
disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at\
home. She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve, and\
preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was\
easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr.\
Dashwood had, of course, found it out very soon, but promised to be\
dumb; and, for a wonder, kept his word.\
\
She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\
nothing of which she should be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\
conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her\
earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.\
\
But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales; and, as thrills could\
not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, history\
and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic\
asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her\
innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world\
which underlies society; so, regarding it in a business light, she set\
about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to\
find material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if\
not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,\
incidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians\
by asking for works on poisons; she studied faces in the street, and\
characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the\
dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as\
good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well\
as her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering\
finely; but, unconsciously, she was beginning to desecrate some of the\
womanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad\
society; and, imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for\
she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and\
was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature\
acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to\
all of us.\
\
She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\
other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating\
about her own,--a morbid amusement, in which healthy young minds do not\
voluntarily indulge. Wrong-doing always brings its own punishment; and,\
when Jo most needed hers, she got it.\
\
I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\
character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\
brave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\
perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested\
her in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their\
conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely\
characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo\
took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him,--a\
proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the\
worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.\
\
Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither\
rich nor great, young nor handsome; in no respect what is called\
fascinating, imposing, or brilliant; and yet he was as attractive as a\
genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about\
a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something\
away; a stranger, yet every one was his friend; no longer young, but as\
happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked\
beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake.\
Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and, at last,\
decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any\
sorrow, "it sat with its head under its wing," and he turned only his\
sunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time\
seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\
others. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\
friendly words and cheery laughs; his eyes were never cold or hard, and\
his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\
words.\
\
His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\
wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\
comfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\
underneath; his rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\
plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full;\
his very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\
like other people's.\
\
"That's it!" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\
genuine good-will towards one's fellow-men could beautify and dignify\
even a stout German teacher, who shovelled in his dinner, darned his own\
socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.\
\
Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\
respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\
Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\
and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\
honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\
to see him, and, in a conversation with Miss Norton, divulged the\
pleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better\
because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was\
an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in\
America; and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the\
spice of romance which this discovery gave it.\
\
Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\
unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the _entr\'e9e_ into literary society,\
which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary\
woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\
favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with\
her, one night, to a select symposium, held in honor of several\
celebrities.\
\
                   [Illustration: A select symposium]\
\
Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had\
worshipped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence for\
genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to\
recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and\
women after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid\
admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on\
"spirit, fire, and dew," to behold him devouring his supper with an\
ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a\
fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her\
romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\
with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\
one of the Madame de Sta\'ebls of the age, who looked daggers at another\
Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after out-man\'9cuvring her in\
efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly\
and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech\
impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and\
glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to\
oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was\
charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen\
of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of\
the party.\
\
Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely _d\'e9sillusion\'e9e_,\
that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\
her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\
philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\
intellectual tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond\
Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were\
unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms; and the\
only thing "evolved from her inner consciousness," was a bad headache\
after it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was\
being picked to pieces, and put together on new, and, according to the\
talkers, on infinitely better principles than before; that religion was\
in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be\
the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any\
sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came\
over her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time\
and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.\
\
She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\
looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\
He shook his head, and beckoned her to come away; but she was\
fascinated, just then, by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and\
kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to\
rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.\
\
Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man, and slow to offer his own opinions,\
not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\
lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\
attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his\
brows, and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\
would be led astray by the rockets, to find, when the display was over,\
that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.\
\
He bore it as long as he could; but when he was appealed to for an\
opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation, and defended religion\
with all the eloquence of truth,--an eloquence which made his broken\
English musical, and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for\
the wise men argued well; but he didn't know when he was beaten, and\
stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got\
right again to Jo; the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\
better than the new; God was not a blind force, and immortality was not\
a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground\
under her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer paused, out-talked, but not one\
whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.\
\
She did neither; but she remembered this scene, and gave the Professor\
her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\
then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She\
began to see that character is a better possession than money, rank,\
intellect, or beauty; and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man\
has defined it to be, "truth, reverence, and good-will," then her friend\
Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.\
\
This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his\
respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship; and, just when the\
wish was sincerest, she came near losing everything. It all grew out of\
a cocked hat; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her\
lesson, with a paper soldier-cap on his head, which Tina had put there,\
and he had forgotten to take off.\
\
"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down," thought\
Jo, with a smile, as he said "Goot efening," and sat soberly down, quite\
unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\
head-gear, for he was going to read her the "Death of Wallenstein."\
\
      [Illustration: He doesn't prink at his glass before coming]\
\
She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\
hearty laugh, when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\
it for himself, and presently forgot all about it; for to hear a German\
read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came\
the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night,\
and the cocked-hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor\
didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last, to ask, with an\
air of mild surprise that was irresistible,--\
\
"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\
respect for me, that you go on so bad?"\
\
"How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off?"\
said Jo.\
\
Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt\
and removed the little cocked-hat, looked at it a minute, and then threw\
back his head, and laughed like a merry bass-viol.\
\
"Ah! I see him now; it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap.\
Well, it is nothing; but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too\
shall wear him."\
\
But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes, because Mr. Bhaer\
caught sight of a picture on the hat, and, unfolding it, said, with an\
air of great disgust,--\
\
"I wish these papers did not come in the house; they are not for\
children to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no\
patience with those who make this harm."\
\
Jo glanced at the sheet, and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\
lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it; but the\
impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure, but fear,\
because, for a minute, she fancied the paper was the "Volcano." It was\
not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that, even if it\
had been, and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name\
to betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush;\
for, though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than\
people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the\
newspaper offices more than once; but as she never spoke of it, he asked\
no questions, in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it\
occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\
troubled him. He did not say to himself, "It is none of my business;\
I've no right to say anything," as many people would have done; he only\
remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's\
love and father's care; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as\
quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to\
save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a\
minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face; and by the time the\
paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite\
naturally, but very gravely,--\
\
"Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not like to think that good\
young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some, but\
I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad\
trash."\
\
"All may not be bad, only silly, you know; and if there is a demand for\
it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people\
make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories," said\
Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits\
followed her pin.\
\
"There is a demand for whiskey, but I think you and I do not care to\
sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\
not feel that the living _was_ honest. They haf no right to put poison\
in the sugar-plum, and let the small ones eat it. No; they should think\
a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing."\
\
Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\
his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her; for her\
cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke, and gone\
harmlessly up the chimney.\
\
"I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered the\
Professor, coming back with a relieved air.\
\
Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\
hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\
Then she thought consolingly to herself, "Mine are not like that; they\
are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried;" and taking up her\
book, she said, with a studious face,--\
\
"Shall we go on, sir? I'll be very good and proper now."\
\
"I shall hope so," was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined;\
and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words\
"Weekly Volcano" were printed in large type on her forehead.\
\
As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully\
re-read every one of her stories. Being a little short-sighted, Mr.\
Bhaer sometimes used eye-glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to\
see how they magnified the fine print of her book; now she seemed to\
have got on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also; for the\
faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully, and filled her\
with dismay.\
\
"They _are_ trash, and will soon be worse than trash if I go on; for\
each is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting\
myself and other people, for the sake of money; I know it's so, for I\
can't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of\
it; and what _should_ I do if they were seen at home, or Mr. Bhaer got\
hold of them?"\
\
Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\
stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.\
\
         [Illustration: Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove]\
\
"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense; I'd better\
burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up\
with my gunpowder," she thought, as she watched the "Demon of the Jura"\
whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.\
\
But when nothing remained of all her three months' work except a heap of\
ashes, and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\
floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\
\
"I think I haven't done much harm _yet_, and may keep this to pay for my\
time," she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, "I almost\
wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care\
about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\
should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that father and\
mother hadn't been so particular about such things."\
\
Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that "father and mother\
_were_ particular," and pity from your heart those who have no such\
guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like\
prison-walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations\
to build character upon in womanhood.\
\
Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not\
pay for her share of the sensation; but, going to the other extreme, as\
is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood,\
Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More; and then produced a tale which might\
have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral\
was it. She had her doubts about it from the beginning; for her lively\
fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she\
would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the\
last century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it\
found no purchaser; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood,\
that morals didn't sell.\
\
Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\
if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The\
only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\
juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\
convert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to\
write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys\
as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls, because they did not go\
to a particular Sabbath-school, nor all the good infants, who did go, as\
rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of\
angels, when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their\
lisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials; and Jo corked up her\
inkstand, and said, in a fit of very wholesome humility,--\
\
"I don't know anything; I'll wait till I do before I try again, and,\
meantime, 'sweep mud in the street,' if I can't do better; that's\
honest, at least;" which decision proved that her second tumble down the\
bean-stalk had done her some good.\
\
While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\
been as busy and uneventful as usual; and if she sometimes looked\
serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did\
it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\
accept and profit by his reproof; but she stood the test, and he was\
satisfied; for, though no words passed between them, he knew that she\
had given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\
second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\
evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\
studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\
occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.\
\
He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was\
happy; for, while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons\
beside German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her\
own life.\
\
It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.\
Kirke till June. Every one seemed sorry when the time came; the children\
were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all over his\
head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\
\
"Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in," he said,\
when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard, in the corner,\
while she held a little levee on that last evening.\
\
She was going early, so she bade them all good-by over night; and when\
his turn came, she said warmly,--\
\
"Now, sir, you won't forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our\
way, will you? I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to\
know my friend."\
\
"Do you? Shall I come?" he asked, looking down at her with an eager\
expression which she did not see.\
\
"Yes, come next month; Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy\
Commencement as something new."\
\
"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?" he said, in an altered\
tone.\
\
"Yes, my boy Teddy; I'm very proud of him, and should like you to see\
him."\
\
Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in\
the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's\
face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a\
"best friend," and, simply because she particularly wished not to look\
as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush; and the\
more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina\
on her knee, she didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately,\
the child was moved to hug her; so she managed to hide her face an\
instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own\
changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he\
said cordially,--\
\
"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much\
success, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!" and with that, he shook\
hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.\
\
But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire, with the\
tired look on his face, and the "_heimweh_," or homesickness, lying\
heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo, as she sat with the\
little child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his\
head on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in\
search of something that he could not find.\
\
"It is not for me; I must not hope it now," he said to himself, with a\
sigh that was almost a groan; then, as if reproaching himself for the\
longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two towzled\
heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened\
his Plato.\
\
He did his best, and did it manfully; but I don't think he found that a\
pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very\
satisfactory substitutes for wife and child and home.\
\
Early as it was, he was at the station, next morning, to see Jo off;\
and, thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant\
memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to\
keep her company, and, best of all, the happy thought,--\
\
"Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books, earned no fortune;\
but I've made a friend worth having, and I'll try to keep him all my\
life."\
\
\
\
\
          [Illustration: He put the sisters into the carriage]\
\
                                 XXXV.\
\
                               HEARTACHE.\
\
\
Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that\
year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with the\
grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends\
said. They were all there, his grandfather,--oh, so proud!--Mr. and Mrs.\
March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the\
sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win\
from the world by any after-triumphs.\
\
"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early\
to-morrow; you'll come and meet me as usual, girls?" Laurie said, as he\
put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.\
He said "girls," but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up\
the old custom; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful\
boy anything, and answered warmly,--\
\
"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing '_Hail\
the conquering hero comes_,' on a jews-harp."\
\
Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think, in a sudden panic,\
"Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?"\
\
Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and\
having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were\
going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her\
answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy\
wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings. A call\
at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn,\
still further fortified her for the _t\'eate-\'e0-t\'eate_, but when she saw a\
stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn\
about and run away.\
\
"Where's the jews-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within\
speaking distance.\
\
"I forgot it;" and Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be\
called lover-like.\
\
She always used to take his arm on these occasions; now she did not, and\
he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about\
all sorts of far-away subjects, till they turned from the road into the\
little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more\
slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and, now and then, a\
dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the\
wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily,--\
\
"Now you must have a good long holiday!"\
\
"I intend to."\
\
Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him\
looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded\
moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring,--\
\
"No, Teddy, please don't!"\
\
"I will, and you _must_ hear me. It's no use, Jo; we've got to have it\
out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he answered, getting\
flushed and excited all at once.\
\
"Say what you like, then; I'll listen," said Jo, with a desperate sort\
of patience.\
\
Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to "have it\
out," if he died in the attempt; so he plunged into the subject with\
characteristic impetuosity, saying in a voice that _would_ get choky now\
and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady,--\
\
"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo; couldn't help it, you've\
been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me; now\
I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I _can't_ go on\
so any longer."\
\
"I wanted to save you this; I thought you'd understand--" began Jo,\
finding it a great deal harder than she expected.\
\
"I know you did; but girls are so queer you never know what they mean.\
They say No when they mean Yes, and drive a man out of his wits just for\
the fun of it," returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an\
undeniable fact.\
\
"_I_ don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away\
to keep you from it if I could."\
\
"I thought so; it was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all\
the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and\
everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I hoped\
you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough--" here there was a choke\
that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he\
cleared his "confounded throat."\
\
"Yes, you are; you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful\
to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't see why I can't love you\
as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it\
would be a lie to say I do when I don't."\
\
"Really, truly, Jo?"\
\
He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with\
a look that she did not soon forget.\
\
"Really, truly, dear."\
\
They were in the grove now, close by the stile; and when the last words\
fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as\
if to go on, but for once in his life that fence was too much for him;\
so he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that\
Jo was frightened.\
\
        [Illustration: He laid his head down on the mossy post]\
\
"O Teddy, I'm so sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it\
would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard. I can't help it;\
you know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people\
if they don't," cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly\
patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so\
long ago.\
\
"They do sometimes," said a muffled voice from the post.\
\
"I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try\
it," was the decided answer.\
\
There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by\
the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said\
very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile,--\
\
"Laurie, I want to tell you something."\
\
He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out, in\
a fierce tone--\
\
"_Don't_ tell me that, Jo; I can't bear it now!"\
\
"Tell what?" she asked, wondering at his violence.\
\
"That you love that old man."\
\
"What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.\
\
"That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you\
love him, I know I shall do something desperate;" and he looked as if he\
would keep his word, as he clenched his hands, with a wrathful spark in\
his eyes.\
\
Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself, and said warmly, for she,\
too, was getting excited with all this,--\
\
"Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind,\
and the best friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a\
passion; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my\
Professor. I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else."\
\
"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?"\
\
"You'll love some one else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this\
trouble."\
\
"I _can't_ love any one else; and I'll never forget you, Jo, never!\
never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.\
\
"What _shall_ I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more\
unmanageable than she expected. "You haven't heard what I wanted to tell\
you. Sit down and listen; for indeed I want to do right and make you\
happy," she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which\
proved that she knew nothing about love.\
\
Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on\
the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,\
and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was\
not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part; for how\
_could_ she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes\
full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or\
two her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head\
away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to\
grow for her sake,--how touching that was, to be sure!--\
\
"I agree with mother that you and I are not suited to each other,\
because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very\
miserable, if we were so foolish as to--" Jo paused a little over the\
last word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression,--\
\
"Marry,--no, we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect\
saint, for you could make me anything you like."\
\
"No, I can't. I've tried it and failed, and I won't risk our happiness\
by such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall; so\
we'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything\
rash."\
\
"Yes, we will if we get the chance," muttered Laurie rebelliously.\
\
"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case," implored\
Jo, almost at her wit's end.\
\
"I won't be reasonable; I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible\
view;' it won't help me, and it only makes you harder. I don't believe\
you've got any heart."\
\
"I wish I hadn't!"\
\
There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen,\
Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he\
said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously\
wheedlesome before,--\
\
"Don't disappoint us, dear! Every one expects it. Grandpa has set his\
heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say\
you will, and let's be happy. Do, do!"\
\
Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of\
mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that\
she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but\
she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.\
\
"I can't say 'Yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm\
right, by and by, and thank me for it"--she began solemnly.\
\
"I'll be hanged if I do!" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning\
with indignation at the bare idea.\
\
"Yes, you will!" persisted Jo; "you'll get over this after a while, and\
find some lovely, accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine\
mistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and\
odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel,--we\
can't help it even now, you see,--and I shouldn't like elegant society\
and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on\
without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and\
everything would be horrid!"\
\
"Anything more?" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to\
this prophetic burst.\
\
"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy\
as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up\
for any mortal man."\
\
"I know better!" broke in Laurie. "You think so now; but there'll come a\
time when you _will_ care for somebody, and you'll love him\
tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way,\
and I shall have to stand by and see it;" and the despairing lover cast\
his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical,\
if his face had not been so tragical.\
\
"Yes, I _will_ live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love\
him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!" cried Jo,\
losing patience with poor Teddy. "I've done my best, but you _won't_ be\
reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't\
give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but\
I'll never marry you; and the sooner you believe it, the better for both\
of us,--so now!"\
\
That speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as\
if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply\
away, saying, in a desperate sort of tone,--\
\
"You'll be sorry some day, Jo."\
\
"Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened her.\
\
"To the devil!" was the consoling answer.\
\
For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank,\
toward the river; but it takes much folly, sin, or misery to send a\
young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort\
who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a\
melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and\
coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time\
up the river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and\
unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip\
the trouble which he carried in his heart.\
\
"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent\
state of mind, that I sha'n't dare to see him," she said; adding, as she\
went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,\
and buried it under the leaves,--\
\
"Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.\
I wish he'd love Beth; perhaps he may, in time, but I begin to think I\
was mistaken about her. Oh dear! how can girls like to have lovers and\
refuse them. I think it's dreadful."\
\
Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight\
to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke\
down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old\
gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He\
found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie,\
and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo\
that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly, and resolved to\
carry his boy out of harm's way; for Young Impetuosity's parting words\
to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.\
\
When Laurie came home, dead tired, but quite composed, his grandfather\
met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very\
successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the\
twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the\
old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to\
listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed\
love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his\
piano, and began to play. The windows were open; and Jo, walking in the\
garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for\
he played the "Sonata Path\'e9tique," and played it as he never did before.\
\
"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry; give\
us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was\
full of sympathy, which he longed to show, but knew not how.\
\
Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several\
minutes, and would have got through bravely, if, in a momentary lull,\
Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling,--\
\
"Jo, dear, come in; I want you."\
\
Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he\
listened, he lost his place; the music ended with a broken chord, and\
the musician sat silent in the dark.\
\
"I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his\
way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and\
said, as gently as a woman,--\
\
"I know, my boy, I know."\
\
No answer for an instant; then Laurie asked sharply,--\
\
"Who told you?"\
\
"Jo herself."\
\
"Then there's an end of it!" and he shook off his grandfather's hands\
with an impatient motion; for, though grateful for the sympathy, his\
man's pride could not bear a man's pity.\
\
"Not quite; I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of\
it," returned Mr. Laurence, with unusual mildness. "You won't care to\
stay at home just now, perhaps?"\
\
"I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her,\
and I shall stay and do it as long as I like," interrupted Laurie, in a\
defiant tone.\
\
"Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the\
girl can't help it; and the only thing left for you to do is to go away\
for a time. Where will you go?"\
\
"Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me;" and Laurie got up, with a\
reckless laugh, that grated on his grandfather's ear.\
\
"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not\
go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"\
\
"I can't."\
\
"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got\
through college."\
\
"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!" and Laurie walked fast through the\
room, with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.\
\
"I don't ask you to go alone; there's some one ready and glad to go with\
you, anywhere in the world."\
\
"Who, sir?" stopping to listen.\
\
"Myself."\
\
Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying\
huskily,--\
\
"I'm a selfish brute; but--you know--grandfather--"\
\
"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before, once\
in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just\
sit quietly down, and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried\
out at once," said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if\
fearful that he would break away, as his father had done before him.\
\
"Well, sir, what is it?" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest\
in face or voice.\
\
"There is business in London that needs looking after; I meant you\
should attend to it; but I can do it better myself, and things here will\
get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost\
everything; I'm merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off\
at any time."\
\
"But you hate travelling, sir; I can't ask it of you at your age," began\
Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\
alone, if he went at all.\
\
The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\
prevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that\
it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a\
natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind\
him, he said stoutly,--\
\
"Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it\
will do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for travelling nowadays\
is almost as easy as sitting in a chair."\
\
A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,\
or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--\
\
"I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden; I go because I think you'd\
feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend to gad about with\
you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my\
own way. I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\
them; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you\
will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's\
content."\
\
Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken, and the\
world a howling wilderness; but at the sound of certain words which the\
old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken\
heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly\
appeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a\
spiritless tone,--\
\
"Just as you like, sir; it doesn't matter where I go or what I do."\
\
"It does to me, remember that, my lad; I give you entire liberty, but I\
trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie."\
\
"Anything you like, sir."\
\
"Good," thought the old gentleman. "You don't care now, but there'll\
come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm much\
mistaken."\
\
Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was\
hot; and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,\
they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore\
himself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody,\
irritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress,\
and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,\
but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical\
face that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy\
sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his\
unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\
attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a\
relief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very\
uncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the "poor, dear fellow was\
going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy." Of course, he\
smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad\
superiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was\
unalterable.\
\
When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain\
inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This\
gayety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did,\
for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\
a whisper full of motherly solicitude; then, feeling that he was going\
very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the\
afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a\
minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look\
round, came back, put his arms about her, as she stood on the step above\
him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both\
eloquent and pathetic.\
\
"O Jo, can't you?"\
\
                    [Illustration: O Jo, can't you?]\
\
"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!"\
\
That was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself\
up, said "It's all right, never mind," and went away without another\
word. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo _did_ mind; for while the\
curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if\
she had stabbed her dearest friend; and when he left her without a look\
behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.\
\
                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\
\
\
\
\
                                 XXXVI.\
\
                             BETH'S SECRET.\
\
\
When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in\
Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too\
gradually to startle those who saw her daily; but to eyes sharpened by\
absence, it was very plain; and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she\
saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in\
the autumn; yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if\
the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining\
through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw\
and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression\
lost much of its power; for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt\
that she was better; and, presently, in other cares, Jo for a time\
forgot her fear.\
\
But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety\
returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven;\
but when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth had\
thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home.\
Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and, as\
grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth\
down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and\
let the fresh sea-breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.\
\
It was not a fashionable place, but, even among the pleasant people\
there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.\
Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care\
for any one else; so they were all in all to each other, and came and\
went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about\
them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble\
one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long\
separation was not far away.\
\
They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often between ourselves\
and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is\
very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart\
and Beth's; but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed\
something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She\
wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see\
what she saw; and, during the quiet weeks, when the shadow grew so plain\
to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would\
tell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if\
her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing\
through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks,\
with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her,\
and the sea made music at her feet.\
\
     [Illustration: With her head in Jo's lap, while the wind blew\
                        healthfully over her]\
\
One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still; and,\
putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to\
see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she could not\
find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands\
seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been\
gathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was\
slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened\
their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her\
eyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking\
up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say,--\
\
"Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I\
couldn't."\
\
There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even\
tears; for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker,\
then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about\
her, and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.\
\
"I've known it for a good while, dear, and, now I'm used to it, it isn't\
hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so, and don't be troubled\
about me, because it's best; indeed it is."\
\
"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel\
it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?" asked Jo, refusing\
to see or say that it _was_ best, but glad to know that Laurie had no\
part in Beth's trouble.\
\
"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to\
think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble any one. But\
when I saw you all so well and strong, and full of happy plans, it was\
hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,\
Jo."\
\
"O Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you! How\
could you shut me out, and bear it all alone?"\
\
Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of\
the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say\
good-by to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.\
\
"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right; I wasn't sure, no one\
said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to\
frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and\
you so happy with Laurie,--at least, I thought so then."\
\
"And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I\
couldn't," cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.\
\
Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,\
and added softly,--\
\
"Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor\
little heart full of love-lornity all that while."\
\
"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?" asked Beth, as\
innocently as a child. "I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how\
can I help it? But he never could be anything to me but my brother. I\
hope he truly will be, sometime."\
\
"Not through me," said Jo decidedly. "Amy is left for him, and they\
would suit excellently; but I have no heart for such things, now. I\
don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You _must_ get well."\
\
"I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel\
more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the tide, Jo, when\
it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped."\
\
"It _shall_ be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too\
young. Beth, I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight against\
it. I'll keep you in spite of everything; there must be ways, it can't\
be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you from me," cried poor\
Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than\
Beth's.\
\
Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety; it shows itself\
in acts, rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or\
protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave\
her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death.\
Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to\
God and nature, Father and mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and\
they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and\
the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only\
loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to\
the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned,\
but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, "I'm\
glad to go," for life was very sweet to her; she could only sob out, "I\
try to be willing," while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave\
of this great sorrow broke over them together.\
\
By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity,--\
\
"You'll tell them this when we go home?"\
\
"I think they will see it without words," sighed Jo; for now it seemed\
to her that Beth changed every day.\
\
"Perhaps not; I've heard that the people who love best are often\
blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them for\
me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them. Meg has\
John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by father and\
mother, won't you, Jo?"\
\
"If I can; but, Beth, I don't give up yet; I'm going to believe that it\
_is_ a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true," said Jo, trying to\
speak cheerfully.\
\
Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way,--\
\
"I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try, to any one but\
you, because I can't speak out, except to my Jo. I only mean to say\
that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm\
not like the rest of you; I never made any plans about what I'd do when\
I grew up; I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't\
seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about\
at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and\
the hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems\
as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven."\
\
Jo could not speak; and for several minutes there was no sound but the\
sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew\
by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth watched it\
till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little\
gray-coated sand-bird came tripping over the beach, "peeping" softly to\
itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea; it came quite close to Beth,\
looked at her with a friendly eye, and sat upon a warm stone, dressing\
its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled, and felt comforted, for\
the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship, and remind her that\
a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.\
\
"Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the\
gulls: they are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding\
little things. I used to call them my birds, last summer; and mother\
said they reminded her of me,--busy, quaker-colored creatures, always\
near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of\
theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the\
wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the\
turtle-dove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up\
among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear\
little girl! she's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender; and\
no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall\
see her again, but she seems _so_ far away."\
\
"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to\
see and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,"\
began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change\
was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought\
aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.\
\
"Jo, dear, don't hope any more; it won't do any good, I'm sure of that.\
We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We'll\
have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide will go\
out easily, if you help me."\
\
Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face; and with that silent kiss, she\
dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.\
\
She was right: there was no need of any words when they got home, for\
father and mother saw plainly, now, what they had prayed to be saved\
from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed,\
saying how glad she was to be at home; and when Jo went down, she found\
that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret. Her\
father stood leaning his head on the mantel-piece, and did not turn as\
she came in; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and\
Jo went to comfort her without a word.\

\
                            NEW IMPRESSIONS.\
\
\
At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may\
be seen on the Promenade des Anglais,--a charming place; for the wide\
walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on\
one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels\
and villas, while beyond lie orange-orchards and the hills. Many nations\
are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn; and, on a\
sunny day, the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty\
English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly\
Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter\
here, chatting over the news, and criticising the latest celebrity who\
has arrived,--Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the\
Sandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company, and\
attract as much attention, especially the low basket-barouches in which\
ladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep\
their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and\
little grooms on the perch behind.\
\
Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with\
his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.\
He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the\
independent air of an American,--a combination which caused sundry pairs\
of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in\
black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and\
orange-flowers in their button-holes, to shrug their shoulders, and then\
envy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but\
the young man took little notice of them, except to glance, now and\
then, at some blonde girl, or lady in blue. Presently he strolled out of\
the promenade, and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided\
whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to\
wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies'\
feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a\
single lady, came rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde,\
and dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up,\
and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.\
\
"O Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!" cried Amy,\
dropping the reins, and holding out both hands, to the great\
scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps,\
lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these\
"mad English."\
\
"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,\
and here I am."\
\
"How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?"\
\
"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you\
were all out."\
\
"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in, and we can\
talk at our ease; I was going for a drive, and longing for company.\
Flo's saving up for to-night."\
\
"What happens then, a ball?"\
\
"A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and\
they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt\
will be charmed."\
\
"Thank you. Where now?" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms,\
a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive; for her\
parasol-whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs, afforded her\
infinite satisfaction.\
\
"I'm going to the banker's first, for letters, and then to Castle Hill;\
the view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever\
been there?"\
\
"Often, years ago; but I don't mind having a look at it."\
\
"Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your\
grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."\
\
"Yes, I spent a month there, and then joined him in Paris, where he has\
settled for the winter. He has friends there, and finds plenty to amuse\
him; so I go and come, and we get on capitally."\
\
"That's a sociable arrangement," said Amy, missing something in Laurie's\
manner, though she couldn't tell what.\
\
"Why, you see he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still; so we each\
suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he\
enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that some one is glad to see\
me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?" he\
added, with a look of disgust, as they drove along the boulevard to the\
Place Napoleon, in the old city.\
\
"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are\
delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross-streets are my\
delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass; it's\
going to the Church of St. John."\
\
While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their\
canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood\
in blue, chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort\
of shyness steal over her; for he was changed, and she could not find\
the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was\
handsomer than ever, and greatly improved, she thought; but now that the\
flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and\
spiritless,--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a\
year or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't\
understand it, and did not venture to ask questions; so she shook her\
head, and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the\
arches of the Paglioni bridge, and vanished in the church.\
\
"_Que pensez vous_?" she said, airing her French, which had improved in\
quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.\
\
"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is\
charming," replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his heart, and an\
admiring look.\
\
She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy\
her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he\
promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was\
"altogether jolly," with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the\
head. She didn't like the new tone; for, though not _blas\'e9_, it sounded\
indifferent in spite of the look.\
\
"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy," she\
thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying\
meantime to seem quite easy and gay.\
\
At Avigdor's she found the precious home-letters, and, giving the reins\
to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between\
green hedges, where tea-roses bloomed as freshly as in June.\
\
"Beth is very poorly, mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but\
they all say 'stay;' so I do, for I shall never have another chance like\
this," said Amy, looking sober over one page.\
\
"I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a\
great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying\
so much, my dear."\
\
He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self, as he said\
that; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,\
for the look, the act, the brotherly "my dear," seemed to assure her\
that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.\
Presently she laughed, and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her\
scribbling-suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing\
from her mouth the words, "Genius burns!"\
\
Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest-pocket, "to keep it from\
blowing away," and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read\
him.\
\
"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the\
morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night," said\
Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of\
splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.\
While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs\
to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,\
with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had\
wrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and\
approve; for, overlooking a few little affectations of speech and\
manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of\
that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call\
elegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain _aplomb_\
in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman\
of the world than she was; but her old petulance now and then showed\
itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was\
unspoiled by foreign polish.\
\
Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but\
he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty\
little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which\
brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks,\
the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the\
pleasant scene.\
\
As they came up on to the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved\
her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing\
here and there,--\
\
"Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging\
their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's\
Tower, just below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which\
they say is Corsica?"\
\
"I remember; it's not much changed," he answered, without enthusiasm.\
\
"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!" said Amy, feeling\
in good spirits, and anxious to see him so also.\
\
"Yes," was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the\
island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting\
in his sight.\
\
"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you\
have been doing with yourself all this while," said Amy, seating\
herself, ready for a good talk.\
\
But she did not get it; for, though he joined her, and answered all her\
questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the\
continent and been to Greece. So, after idling away an hour, they drove\
home again; and, having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left\
them, promising to return in the evening.\
\
It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately "prinked" that night.\
Time and absence had done its work on both the young people; she had\
seen her old friend in a new light, not as "our boy," but as a handsome\
and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to\
find favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of\
them, with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty\
woman.\
\
Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them\
on such occasions, and, following the sensible English fashion of simple\
dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh\
flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were\
both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist\
sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique\
_coiffures_, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear\
heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon\
such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep\
our hearts merry with their artless vanities.\
\
"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home," said Amy\
to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball-dress, and covered\
it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and\
golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the\
sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a\
Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.\
\
"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a\
fright of myself," she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or\
braid, as the latest style commanded.\
\
Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped\
her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white\
shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she\
surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and\
_chass\'e9ed_ down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.\
\
"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the\
real lace on aunt's _mouchoir_ gives an air to my whole dress. If I only\
had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy," she said,\
surveying herself with a critical eye, and a candle in each hand.\
\
In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as\
she glided away; she seldom ran,--it did not suit her style, she\
thought, for, being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate\
than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon\
while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the\
chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair; then she thought\
better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed\
of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so\
happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in\
so quietly she did not hear him; and, as she stood at the distant\
window, with her head half turned, and one hand gathering up her dress,\
the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a\
well-placed statue.\
\
"Good evening, Diana!" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she\
liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.\
\
"Good evening, Apollo!" she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too,\
looked unusually _debonnaire_, and the thought of entering the ball-room\
on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain\
Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.\
\
"Here are your flowers; I arranged them myself, remembering that you\
didn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay,'" said Laurie, handing her\
a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily\
passed it in Cardiglia's window.\
\
                  [Illustration: Here are your flowers]\
\
"How kind you are!" she exclaimed gratefully. "If I'd known you were\
coming I'd have had something ready for you to-day, though not as pretty\
as this, I'm afraid."\
\
"Thank you; it isn't what it should be, but you have improved it," he\
added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.\
\
"Please don't."\
\
"I thought you liked that sort of thing?"\
\
"Not from you; it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness\
better."\
\
"I'm glad of it," he answered, with a look of relief; then buttoned her\
gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do\
when they went to parties together, at home.\
\
The company assembled in the long _salle \'e0 manger_, that evening, was\
such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans\
had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and, having no\
prejudice against titles, secured a few to add lustre to their Christmas\
ball.\
\
A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour, and talk\
with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother, in black velvet, with\
a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted\
himself to the ladies, who pronounced him "a fascinating dear," and a\
German Serene Something, having come for the supper alone, roamed\
vaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild's private\
secretary, a large-nosed Jew, in tight boots, affably beamed upon the\
world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo; a stout\
Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,\
and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little\
family of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced\
American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few\
plain but piquante French demoiselles; likewise the usual set of\
travelling young gentlemen, who disported themselves gayly, while mammas\
of all nations lined the walls, and smiled upon them benignly when they\
danced with their daughters.\
\
Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she "took the stage"\
that night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked well, she loved\
to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ball-room,\
and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls\
first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by\
virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls,\
who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and\
three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest\
manner as she passed; which was good of her, as it permitted them to see\
her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking\
friend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her\
eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently; for\
she danced well, and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she\
received can better be imagined than described, when he said, in a\
perfectly tranquil tone,--\
\
"Do you care to dance?"\
\
"One usually does at a ball."\
\
Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as\
fast as possible.\
\
"I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?"\
\
"I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely; but he\
will excuse me, as you are an old friend," said Amy, hoping that the\
name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be\
trifled with.\
\
"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support\
\
        "'A daughter of the gods,\
          Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,'"\
\
was all the satisfaction she got, however.\
\
The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy\
was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon, feeling all the\
while as if she could dance the Tarantula with a relish. Laurie resigned\
her to the "nice little boy," and went to do his duty to Flo, without\
securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of\
forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself\
till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence.\
She showed him her ball-book with demure satisfaction when he strolled,\
instead of rushing, up to claim her for the next, a glorious\
polka-redowa; but his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when\
she gallopaded away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt\
with an actual expression of relief.\
\
That was unpardonable; and Amy took no more notice of him for a long\
while, except a word now and then, when she came to her chaperon,\
between the dances, for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger\
had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and\
seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her with\
pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit\
and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very\
naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view; and, before\
the evening was half over, had decided that "little Amy was going to\
make a very charming woman."\
\
It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took\
possession of every one, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,\
hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged\
as if they enjoyed it; everybody danced who could, and those who\
couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark\
with Davises, and many Joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes.\
The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor, with a\
dashing Frenchwoman, who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train.\
The Serene Teuton found the supper-table, and was happy, eating steadily\
through the bill of fare, and dismayed the _gar\'e7ons_ by the ravages he\
committed. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he\
danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu\
pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that\
stout man was charming to behold; for, though he "carried weight," he\
danced like an india-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced; his face\
glowed, his bald head shone; his coat-tails waved wildly, his pumps\
actually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the\
drops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow-men like a French\
Pickwick without glasses.\
\
Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm, but more\
graceful agility; and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to\
the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as\
indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished\
her, with assurances that he was "desolated to leave so early," she was\
ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.\
\
It had been successful; for, at three-and-twenty, blighted affections\
find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young\
blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the\
enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up\
look as he rose to give her his seat; and when he hurried away to bring\
her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile,--\
\
"Ah, I thought that would do him good!"\
\
"You look like Balzac's 'Femme peinte par elle-m\'eame,'" he said, as he\
fanned her with one hand, and held her coffee-cup in the other.\
\
"My rouge won't come off;" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and\
showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh\
outright.\
\
"What do you call this stuff?" he asked, touching a fold of her dress\
that had blown over his knee.\
\
"Illusion."\
\
"Good name for it; it's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?"\
\
"It's as old as the hills; you have seen it on dozens of girls, and you\
never found out that it was pretty till now--_stupide_!"\
\
"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see."\
\
"None of that, it is forbidden; I'd rather take coffee than compliments\
just now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous."\
\
Laurie sat bolt upright, and meekly took her empty plate, feeling an odd\
sort of pleasure in having "little Amy" order him about; for she had\
lost her shyness now, and felt an irresistible desire to trample on him,\
as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any\
signs of subjection.\
\
"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?" he asked, with a quizzical\
look.\
\
"As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly\
explain?" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but\
wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.\
\
"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,\
the--the--illusion--you know," laughed Laurie, breaking down, and\
helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.\
\
Amy was gratified, but, of course, didn't show it, and demurely\
answered, "Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self; I study as\
well as play; and as for this"--with a little gesture toward her\
dress--"why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used\
to making the most of my poor little things."\
\
Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good\
taste; but Laurie liked her the better for it, and found himself both\
admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of\
opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.\
Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up\
her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of\
the evening, in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought\
this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which\
both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.\

\
                             ON THE SHELF.\
\
\
In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,\
when "_Vive la libert\'e9_" becomes their motto. In America, as every one\
knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their\
freedom with republican zest; but the young matrons usually abdicate\
with the first heir to the throne, and go into a seclusion almost as\
close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they\
like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the\
wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a\
very pretty woman the other day, "I'm as handsome as ever, but no one\
takes any notice of me because I'm married."\
\
Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience\
this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world\
primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and\
beloved than ever.\
\
As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very\
strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter\
exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded\
over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender\
mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen\
department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely\
attentions he had been accustomed to receive; but, as he adored his\
babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing,\
with masculine ignorance, that peace would soon be restored. But three\
months passed, and there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and\
nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was\
neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life "aisy," kept him on short\
commons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small\
commissions for the captive mamma; if he came gayly in at night, eager\
to embrace his family, he was quenched by a "Hush! they are just asleep\
after worrying all day." If he proposed a little amusement at home, "No,\
it would disturb the babies." If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he\
was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided "Leave my children\
for pleasure, never!" His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions\
of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the\
night; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the\
presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp\
sounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening,\
Demi's colic got into the shipping-list, and Daisy's fall affected the\
price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.\
\
The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of\
his wife; home was merely a nursery, and the perpetual "hushing" made\
him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts\
of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no\
signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles\
do,--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone\
to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over\
for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his\
own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a\
lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she\
performed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright\
and attractive, the chess-board ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay\
gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.\
\
John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely;\
but as it was, he gratefully took the next best thing, and enjoyed his\
neighbor's society.\
\
Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a\
relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the\
parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But by and\
by, when the teething worry was over, and the idols went to sleep at\
proper hours, leaving mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and\
find her work-basket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in\
his old dressing-gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender.\
She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did\
not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the\
many evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn\
out with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind\
which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares\
oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much\
devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as\
if they were all nerve and no muscle.\
\
"Yes," she would say, looking in the glass, "I'm getting old and ugly;\
John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife\
and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the\
babies love me; they don't care if I am thin and pale, and haven't time\
to crimp my hair; they are my comfort, and some day John will see what\
I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?"\
\
To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a\
crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which\
soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as\
politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss\
interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.\
Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one\
day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping\
spirits had not escaped her observation.\
\
"I wouldn't tell any one except you, mother; but I really do need\
advice, for, if John goes on so much longer I might as well be widowed,"\
replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib, with an injured\
air.\
\
"Goes on how, my dear?" asked her mother anxiously.\
\
"He's away all day, and at night, when I want to see him, he is\
continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should have\
the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even\
the best of them."\
\
"So are women; don't blame John till you see where you are wrong\
yourself."\
\
"But it can't be right for him to neglect me."\
\
"Don't you neglect him?"\
\
"Why, mother, I thought you'd take my part!"\
\
"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes; but I think the fault is yours,\
Meg."\
\
"I don't see how."\
\
"Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you\
made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure\
time?"\
\
"No; but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."\
\
"I think you could, dear; and I think you ought. May I speak quite\
freely, and will you remember that it's mother who blames as well as\
mother who sympathizes?"\
\
"Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel\
as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for\
everything."\
\
Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and, with a little\
interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly\
together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than\
ever.\
\
"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make,--forgotten\
your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural\
and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before\
you take to different ways; for children should draw you nearer than\
ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing\
to do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not\
spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time."\
\
"I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous; and\
I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him,\
and I don't know how to tell him without words."\
\
"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for\
his little home; but it isn't home without you, and you are always in\
the nursery."\
\
"Oughtn't I to be there?"\
\
"Not all the time; too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you\
are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well\
as to the babies; don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out\
of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as\
well as yours, and the children need him; let him feel that he has his\
part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be\
better for you all."\
\
"You really think so, mother?"\
\
"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it; and I seldom give advice unless I've\
proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just\
as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself\
wholly to you. Poor father took to his books, after I had refused all\
offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled\
along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoilt\
her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell\
sick myself. Then father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything,\
and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been\
able to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home\
happiness: he does not let business wean him from the little cares and\
duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy\
my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but\
at home we work together, always."\
\
"It is so, mother; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children\
what you have been to yours. Show me how; I'll do anything you say."\
\
"You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I'd let\
John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs\
training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have often\
proposed, let Hannah come and help you; she is a capital nurse, and you\
may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. You\
need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his\
wife again. Go out more; keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the\
sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair\
weather. Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes,--talk\
with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in\
that way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman,\
but understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part\
in the world's work, for it all affects you and yours."\
\
"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask\
questions about politics and things."\
\
"I don't believe he would; love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom\
could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn't\
find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers."\
\
"I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I _have_ neglected him sadly, but I\
thought I was right, and he never said anything."\
\
"He tried not to be selfish, but he _has_ felt rather forlorn, I fancy.\
This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow\
apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together; for the\
first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it;\
and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years\
of the little lives given them to train. Don't let John be a stranger to\
the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this\
world of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you\
will learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear,\
good-by; think over mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good,\
and God bless you all!"\
\
Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the\
first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course\
the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they\
found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted.\
Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but papa was not so easily\
subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt\
at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a\
trifle of his sire's firmness of character,--we won't call it\
obstinacy,--and when he made up his little mind to have or to do\
anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change\
that pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be\
taught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was\
too soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when\
he undertook to "wrastle" with "parpar," he always got the worst of it;\
yet, like the Englishman, Baby respected the man who conquered him, and\
loved the father whose grave "No, no," was more impressive than all\
mamma's love-pats.\
\
A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social\
evening with John; so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in\
order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that\
nothing should interfere with her experiment. But, unfortunately, Demi's\
most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he\
decided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sung and rocked, told stories\
and tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain,\
the big eyes wouldn't shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,\
like the chubby little bunch of good-nature she was, naughty Demi lay\
staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression\
of countenance.\
\
"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while mamma runs down and gives\
poor papa his tea?" asked Meg, as the hall-door softly closed, and the\
well-known step went tiptoeing into the dining-room.\
\
"Me has tea!" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.\
\
"No; but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go\
bye-by like Daisy. Will you, lovey?"\
\
"Iss!" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the\
desired day.\
\
Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away, and ran\
down to greet her husband with a smiling face, and the little blue bow\
in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once, and\
said, with pleased surprise,--\
\
"Why, little mother, how gay we are to-night. Do you expect company?"\
\
"Only you, dear."\
\
"Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?"\
\
"No; I'm tired of being a dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always\
make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are; so why\
shouldn't I when I have the time?"\
\
"I do it out of respect to you, my dear," said old-fashioned John.\
\
"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again,\
as she nodded to him over the teapot.\
\
"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes\
right. I drink your health, dear." And John sipped his tea with an air\
of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration, however; for, as\
he put down his cup, the door-handle rattled mysteriously, and a little\
voice was heard, saying impatiently,--\
\
"Opy doy; me's tummin!"\
\
"It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is,\
downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas," said\
Meg, answering the call.\
\
                      [Illustration: Mornin' now]\
\
"Mornin' now," announced Demi, in a joyful tone, as he entered, with his\
long night-gown gracefully festooned over his arm, and every curl\
bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eying the "cakies" with\
loving glances.\
\
"No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor\
mamma; then you can have the little cake with sugar on it."\
\
"Me loves parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal\
knee, and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to\
Meg,--\
\
"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do\
it, or he will never learn to mind you."\
\
"Yes, of course. Come, Demi;" and Meg led her son away, feeling a\
strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,\
laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as\
soon as they reached the nursery.\
\
Nor was he disappointed; for that short-sighted woman actually gave him\
a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more\
promenades till morning.\
\
"Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and\
regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.\
\
Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when\
the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by\
boldly demanding,--\
\
"More sudar, marmar."\
\
"Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against the engaging\
little sinner. "We shall never know any peace till that child learns to\
go to bed properly. You have made a slave of yourself long enough; give\
him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed\
and leave him, Meg."\
\
"He won't stay there; he never does, unless I sit by him."\
\
"I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as mamma\
bids you."\
\
"S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted\
"cakie," and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.\
\
"You must never say that to papa; I shall carry you if you don't go\
yourself."\
\
"Go 'way; me don't love parpar;" and Demi retired to his mother's skirts\
for protection.\
\
But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the\
enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John," which struck the culprit with\
dismay; for when mamma deserted him, then the judgment-day was at hand.\
Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong\
hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but\
openly defied papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the way\
upstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on\
the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by\
the tail of his little toga, and put back again, which lively\
performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out, when he\
devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise\
usually conquered Meg; but John sat as unmoved as the post which is\
popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no\
story; even the light was put out, and only the red glow of the fire\
enlivened the "big dark" which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than\
fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for\
"marmar," as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his\
tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive wail\
which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's heart, and she ran up\
to say beseechingly,--\
\
"Let me stay with him; he'll be good, now, John."\
\
"No, my dear, I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him; and he\
must, if I stay here all night."\
\
"But he'll cry himself sick," pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for\
deserting her boy.\
\
"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off, and then the matter\
is settled; for he will understand that he has got to mind. Don't\
interfere; I'll manage him."\
\
"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness."\
\
"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoilt by indulgence. Go\
down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."\
\
When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never\
regretted her docility.\
\
"Please let me kiss him once, John?"\
\
"Certainly. Demi, say 'good-night' to mamma, and let her go and rest,\
for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."\
\
Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory; for after it\
was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom\
of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.\
\
"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll cover him\
up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest," thought John, creeping to\
the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.\
\
But he wasn't; for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes\
opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying,\
with a penitent hiccough, "Me's dood, now."\
\
Sitting on the stairs, outside, Meg wondered at the long silence which\
followed the uproar; and, after imagining all sorts of impossible\
accidents, she slipped into the room, to set her fears at rest. Demi lay\
fast asleep; not in his usual spread-eagle attitude, but in a subdued\
bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and holding his\
father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and\
had gone to sleep a sadder and a wiser baby. So held, John had waited\
with womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold; and, while\
waiting, had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than\
with his whole day's work.\
\
As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to\
herself, and then slipped away again, saying, in a satisfied tone,--\
\
"I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies: he _does_\
know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi _is_ getting\
too much for me."\
\
When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful\
wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet,\
and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election,\
if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some\
kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was\
such a transparent little person, she couldn't keep a secret to save her\
life, and therefore the clew would soon appear. He read a long debate\
with the most amiable readiness, and then explained it in his most lucid\
manner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent\
questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the\
nation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she\
decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the mission\
of politicians seemed to be calling each other names; but she kept these\
feminine ideas to herself, and when John paused, shook her head, and\
said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity,--\
\
"Well, I really don't see what we are coming to."\
\
John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty\
little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with\
the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.\
\
"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like\
millinery for hers, that's only fair," thought John the Just, adding\
aloud,--\
\
"That's very pretty; is it what you call a breakfast-cap?"\
\
               [Illustration: My dear man, it's a bonnet]\
\
"My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theatre\
bonnet."\
\
"I beg your pardon; it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of\
the fly-away things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?"\
\
"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so;" and\
Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet, and regarding him with an air\
of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.\
\
"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks\
young and happy again," and John kissed the smiling face, to the great\
detriment of the rosebud under the chin.\
\
"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new\
concerts some night; I really need some music to put me in tune. Will\
you, please?"\
\
"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You\
have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall\
enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little mother?"\
\
"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous\
and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and less\
care; so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to\
things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to\
keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my\
time. It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake\
as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately, and\
I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can. You don't object, I\
hope?"\
\
Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little\
bonnet had from utter ruin; all that we have any business to know, is\
that John did _not_ appear to object, judging from the changes which\
gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all\
Paradise by any means, but every one was better for the division of\
labor system; the children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate,\
steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg\
recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome\
exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her\
sensible husband. Home grew home-like again, and John had no wish to\
leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The Scotts came to the Brookes'\
now, and every one found the little house a cheerful place, full of\
happiness, content, and family love. Even gay Sallie Moffatt liked to go\
there. "It is always so quiet and pleasant here; it does me good, Meg,"\
she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to\
discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of\
splendid loneliness; for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies\
there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for\
her.\
\
This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had\
found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to\
use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home-love and mutual\
helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.\
This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent\
to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding\
loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,\
undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age; walking side by side, through fair\
and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of\
the good old Saxon word, the "house-band," and learning, as Meg learned,\
that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of\
ruling it, not as a queen, but a wise wife and mother.\

\
                             LAZY LAURENCE.\
\
\
Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He\
was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed\
to give a home-like charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a\
part. He rather missed the "petting" he used to receive, and enjoyed a\
taste of it again; for no attentions, however flattering, from\
strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls\
at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad\
to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the\
representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she\
would confess. They naturally took comfort in each other's society, and\
were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for, at Nice,\
no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while\
apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were\
half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each\
other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sunk in\
hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to\
please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he\
gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women\
know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any\
kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible,\
trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word\
because one had been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous,\
and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have\
taken them; but, at the same time, he felt that he could not change the\
opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes\
that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful\
surprise.\
\
"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day; I preferred to stay at\
home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to\
sketch; will you come?" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day\
when he lounged in as usual, about noon.\
\
"Well, yes; but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?" he answered\
slowly, for the shaded _salon_ looked inviting, after the glare without.\
\
"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so\
you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves\
nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,\
which were a weak point with Laurie.\
\
"Then I'll go with pleasure;" and he put out his hand for her\
sketch-book. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp--\
\
"Don't trouble yourself; it's no exertion to me, but _you_ don't look\
equal to it."\
\
Laurie lifted his eyebrows, and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran\
downstairs; but when they got into the carriage he took the reins\
himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and\
fall asleep on his perch.\
The two never quarrelled,--Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie\
was too lazy; so, in a minute he peeped under her hat-brim with an\
inquiring air; she answered with a smile, and they went on together in\
the most amicable manner.\
\
It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque\
scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,\
whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a\
bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket\
over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone, while his goats skipped among\
the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with\
panniers of freshly-cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a\
_capaline_ sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning\
with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the\
quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on\
the bough. Gnarled olive-trees covered the hills with their dusky\
foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones\
fringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the\
Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.\
\
Valrosa well deserved its name, for, in that climate of perpetual\
summer, roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust\
themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to\
passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon-trees and\
feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where\
seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom; every cool\
grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every\
fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to\
smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped\
the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of\
the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and\
the white-walled city on its shore.\
\
"This is a regular honeymoon Paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such\
roses?" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a\
luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.\
\
"No, nor felt such thorns," returned Laurie, with his thumb in his\
mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that\
grew just beyond his reach.\
\
"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns," said Amy,\
gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall\
behind her. She put them in his button-hole, as a peace-offering, and he\
stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in\
the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and\
he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,\
when imaginative young men find significance in trifles, and food for\
romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny\
red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like\
that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the\
sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and,\
for a moment, he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the\
next instant his American common-sense got the better of sentimentality,\
and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.\
\
"It's good advice; you'd better take it and save your fingers," she\
said, thinking her speech amused him.\
\
"Thank you, I will," he answered in jest, and a few months later he did\
it in earnest.\
\
"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?" she asked presently,\
as she settled herself on a rustic seat.\
\
"Very soon."\
\
"You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks."\
\
"I dare say; short answers save trouble."\
\
"He expects you, and you really ought to go."\
\
"Hospitable creature! I know it."\
\
"Then why don't you do it?"\
\
"Natural depravity, I suppose."\
\
"Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!" and Amy looked\
severe.\
\
"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I\
might as well stay, and plague you a little longer, you can bear it\
better; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently;" and Laurie\
composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.\
\
Amy shook her head, and opened her sketch-book with an air of\
resignation; but she had made up her mind to lecture "that boy," and in\
a minute she began again.\
\
"What are you doing just now?"\
\
"Watching lizards."\
\
"No, no; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"\
\
"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."\
\
"How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars, and I will only allow\
it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch; I need a\
figure."\
\
"With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me,--full-length or\
three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a\
recumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it '_Dolce far\
niente._'"\
\
"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. _I_ intend to work hard,"\
said Amy, in her most energetic tone.\
\
"What delightful enthusiasm!" and he leaned against a tall urn with an\
air of entire satisfaction.\
\
"What would Jo say if she saw you now?" asked Amy impatiently, hoping to\
stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.\
\
"As usual, 'Go away, Teddy, I'm busy!'" He laughed as he spoke, but the\
laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the\
utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed\
yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them\
before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on\
Laurie's face,--a hard, bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and\
regret. It was gone before she could study it, and the listless\
expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic\
pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in\
the sun with uncovered head, and eyes full of southern dreaminess; for\
he seemed to have forgotten her, and fallen into a reverie.\
\
"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb," she\
said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark\
stone.\
\
"Wish I was!"\
\
"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoilt your life. You are so\
changed, I sometimes think--" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,\
half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.\
\
Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated\
to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to\
say it to her mother,--\
\
"It's all right, ma'am."\
\
That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry\
her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the\
cordial tone in which she said,--\
\
"I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I\
fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost\
your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some\
of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a\
foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun; come and lie on the grass\
here, and 'let us be friendly,' as Jo used to say when we got in the\
sofa-corner and told secrets."\
\
         [Illustration: Laurie threw himself down on the turf]\
\
Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse\
himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay\
there.\
\
"I'm all ready for the secrets;" and he glanced up with a decided\
expression of interest in his eyes.\
\
"I've none to tell; you may begin."\
\
"Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news\
from home."\
\
"You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I\
fancied Jo would send you volumes."\
\
"She's very busy; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,\
you know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?" he\
asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he\
had been wondering if Amy knew his secret, and wanted to talk about it.\
\
"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air. "Rome took all\
the vanity out of me; for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too\
insignificant to live, and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair."\
\
"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"\
\
"That's just why,--because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy\
can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a\
common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."\
\
"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?"\
\
"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the\
chance."\
\
It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes\
young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled,\
but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a\
long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.\
\
"Good! and here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."\
\
Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her\
downcast face, that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,--\
\
"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?"\
\
"I don't promise to answer."\
\
"Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world\
enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and\
you last year, and it's my private opinion that, if he had not been\
called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come\
of it--hey?"\
\
"That's not for me to say," was Amy's prim reply; but her lips would\
smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye, which betrayed\
that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.\
\
"You are not engaged, I hope?" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly\
and grave all of a sudden.\
\
"No."\
\
"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his\
knees, won't you?"\
\
"Very likely."\
\
"Then you are fond of old Fred?"\
\
"I could be, if I tried."\
\
"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what\
unearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied\
you'd like."\
\
"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners," began Amy, trying\
to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself,\
in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.\
\
"I understand; queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean\
to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as\
the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's\
girls."\
\
"True, nevertheless."\
\
A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered\
contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this\
instinctively, and laid himself down again, with a sense of\
disappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well\
as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve\
to deliver her lecture without delay.\
\
"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little," she said\
sharply.\
\
"Do it for me, there's a dear girl."\
\
"I could, if I tried;" and she looked as if she would like doing it in\
the most summary style.\
\
"Try, then; I give you leave," returned Laurie, who enjoyed having some\
one to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.\
\
"You'd be angry in five minutes."\
\
"I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire: you are\
as cool and soft as snow."\
\
"You don't know what I can do; snow produces a glow and a tingle, if\
applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good\
stirring up would prove it."\
\
"Stir away; it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said\
when his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a\
carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees\
with you."\
\
Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the\
apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and\
began:--\
\
"Flo and I have got a new name for you; it's 'Lazy Laurence.' How do you\
like it?"\
\
She thought it would annoy him; but he only folded his arms under his\
head, with an imperturbable "That's not bad. Thank you, ladies."\
\
"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?"\
\
"Pining to be told."\
\
"Well, I despise you."\
\
If she had even said "I hate you," in a petulant or coquettish tone, he\
would have laughed, and rather liked it; but the grave, almost sad,\
accent of her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly,--\
\
"Why, if you please?"\
\
"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are\
faulty, lazy, and miserable."\
\
"Strong language, mademoiselle."\
\
"If you like it, I'll go on."\
\
"Pray, do; it's quite interesting."\
\
"I thought you'd find it so; selfish people always like to talk about\
themselves."\
\
"Am _I_ selfish?" The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone\
of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was\
generosity.\
\
"Yes, very selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as\
effective, just then, as an angry one. "I'll show you how, for I've\
studied you while we have been frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied\
with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing\
but waste time and money and disappoint your friends."\
\
"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-years grind?"\
\
"You don't look as if you'd had much; at any rate, you are none the\
better for it, as far as I can see. I said, when we first met, that you\
had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so nice\
as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy; you like\
gossip, and waste time on frivolous things; you are contented to be\
petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected\
by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty,--ah, you\
like that, Old Vanity! but it's the truth, so I can't help saying\
it,--with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find\
nothing to do but dawdle; and, instead of being the man you might and\
ought to be, you are only--" There she stopped, with a look that had\
both pain and pity in it.\
\
"Saint Laurence on a gridiron," added Laurie, blandly finishing the\
sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a\
wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now, and a half-angry, half-injured\
expression replaced the former indifference.\
\
"I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we\
can make you what we will; but the instant we honestly try to do you\
good, you laugh at us, and won't listen, which proves how much your\
flattery is worth." Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the\
exasperating martyr at her feet.\
\
In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,\
and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child,--\
\
"I will be good, oh, I will be good!"\
\
But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest; and, tapping on the\
outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly,--\
\
"Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a\
woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best\
gloves, and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven!\
so I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal-rings on it, only\
the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was\
here to help me!"\
\
"So do I!"\
\
The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in\
the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a\
new thought in her mind; but he was lying with his hat half over his\
face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his\
chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and\
the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide\
something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute\
various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind,\
and told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered\
that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo; she recalled the shadow on\
his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the\
little old ring, which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are\
quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that\
perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she\
was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and, when she spoke again, it was\
in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to\
make it so.\
\
"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie; and if you weren't\
the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.\
But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they\
should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps,\
they would understand the change better than I do."\
\
"I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as\
touching as a broken one.\
\
"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,\
when I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did\
like that Miss Randal, and now I hate her!" said artful Amy, wishing to\
be sure of her facts this time.\
\
"Hang Miss Randal!" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look\
that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.\
\
"I beg pardon; I thought--" and there she paused diplomatically.\
\
"No, you didn't; you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but\
Jo." Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face\
away as he spoke.\
\
"I did think so; but as they never said anything about it, and you came\
away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I\
was sure she loved you dearly."\
\
"She _was_ kind, but not in the right way; and it's lucky for her she\
didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's\
her fault, though, and you may tell her so."\
\
The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled\
Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.\
\
"I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I can't\
help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."\
\
"Don't, that's her name for me!" and Laurie put up his hand with a quick\
gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, half-reproachful\
tone. "Wait till you've tried it yourself," he added, in a low voice, as\
he pulled up the grass by the handful.\
\
"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved," said\
Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.\
\
Now, Laurie flattered himself that he _had_ borne it remarkably well,\
making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live\
it down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the\
first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first\
failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if\
suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream, and found it impossible to go to\
sleep again. Presently he sat up, and asked slowly,--\
\
"Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?"\
\
"Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you do\
something splendid, and _make_ her love you?"\
\
"I did my best, but it was no use."\
\
"Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have\
done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail\
after spending so much time and money, when every one knew you _could_\
do well."\
\
"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me," began Laurie,\
leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.\
\
"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and\
proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set about\
another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self again,\
and forget your trouble."\
\
"That's impossible."\
\
"Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much she\
knows about such things.' I don't pretend to be wise, but I _am_\
observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm\
interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies; and,\
though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love\
Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's\
wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one\
you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake up and\
be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."\
\
Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on\
his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had\
been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,\
merely saying,--\
\
"How do you like that?"\
\
He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it\
was capitally done,--the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless\
face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the\
little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.\
\
"How well you draw!" he said, with genuine surprise and pleasure at her\
skill, adding, with a half-laugh,--\
\
"Yes, that's me."\
\
"As you are: this is as you were;" and Amy laid another sketch beside\
the one he held.\
\
It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it\
which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a\
sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough\
sketch of Laurie taming a horse; hat and coat were off, and every line\
of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude, was full\
of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching\
his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing\
the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had\
mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect\
attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of\
strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy, that contrasted sharply with\
the supine grace of the "_Dolce far niente_" sketch. Laurie said\
nothing; but, as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush\
up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little\
lesson she had given him. That satisfied her; and, without waiting for\
him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way,--\
\
        [Illustration: A rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse]\
\
"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all\
looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and\
I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the\
other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you."\
\
"Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate\
you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon Paradise' that five\
o'clock is the dinner-hour at your hotel?"\
\
Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow,\
and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures\
should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,\
but it _was_ an affectation now, for the rousing had been more\
efficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his\
manner, and said to herself,--\
\
"Now I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad; if it makes\
him hate me, I'm sorry; but it's true, and I can't take back a word of\
it."\
\
They laughed and chatted all the way home; and little Baptiste, up\
behind, thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits.\
But both felt ill at ease; the friendly frankness was disturbed, the\
sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gayety, there\
was a secret discontent in the heart of each.\
\
"Shall we see you this evening, _mon fr\'e8re_?" asked Amy as they parted\
at her aunt's door.\
\
"Unfortunately I have an engagement. _Au revoir, mademoiselle_," and\
Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became\
him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and\
warmly,--\
\
"No; be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd\
rather have a hearty English hand-shake than all the sentimental\
salutations in France."\
\
"Good-by, dear," and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,\
Laurie left her, after a hand-shake almost painful in its heartiness.\
\
Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made\
her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:--\
\
    "MY DEAR MENTOR,--\
\
    "Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself,\
    for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of\
    boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a\
    blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited\
    by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.\
\
                            "Yours gratefully,          TELEMACHUS."\
\
"Good boy! I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving smile; the\
next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,\
with an involuntary sigh,--\
\
"Yes, I _am_ glad, but how I shall miss him!"\
\
\
\
\
                [Illustration: The Valley of the Shadow]\
\

\
                       THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW.\
\
\
When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\
and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\
affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\
trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward\
making that last year a happy one.\
\
The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\
gathered everything that she most loved,--flowers, pictures, her piano,\
the little work-table, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books\
found their way there, mother's easy-chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\
sketches; and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\
to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,\
that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\
the fruit she loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of\
concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\
as she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\
letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\
that know no winter.\
\
Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil\
and busy as ever; for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature,\
and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for\
those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and\
one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school-children\
daily passing to and fro,--to drop a pair of mittens from her window for\
a pair of purple hands, a needle-book for some small mother of many\
dolls, pen-wipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pot-hooks,\
scrap-books for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices,\
till the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way\
strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as\
a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts\
miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any\
reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her\
window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to\
her, full of blots and gratitude.\
\
The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\
round, and say "How beautiful this is!" as they all sat together in her\
sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\
sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\
the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\
applicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a\
paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying\
to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation\
possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who\
listened; for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the\
frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he\
spoke or read.\
\
It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\
preparation for the sad hours to come; for, by and by, Beth said the\
needle was "so heavy," and put it down forever; talking wearied her,\
faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\
spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\
flesh. Ah me! such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\
hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\
to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\
bitter cry, "Help me, help me!" and to feel that there was no help. A\
sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\
death; but both were mercifully brief, and then, the natural rebellion\
over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of\
her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong; and, though she said little,\
those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\
called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\
trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\
the river.\
\
Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, "I feel stronger when\
you are here." She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\
the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\
asked for anything, and "tried not to be a trouble." All day she haunted\
the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then\
than of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours\
to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed; lessons\
in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn\
them; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly\
forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and\
the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.\
\
Often, when she woke, Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little\
book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw\
her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\
transparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her, with thoughts too\
deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\
trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\
life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\
she loved so well.\
\
Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\
hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with\
eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\
sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life,--uneventful,\
unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which "smell sweet, and\
blossom in the dust," the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\
earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\
to all.\
\
One night, when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\
something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\
hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite\
Pilgrim's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's\
hand. The name caught her eye, and the blurred look of the lines made\
her sure that tears had fallen on it.\
\
"Poor Jo! she's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave; she shows\
me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this,"\
thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the\
tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.\
\
\
                               "MY BETH.\
\
        "Sitting patient in the shadow\
           Till the blessed light shall come,\
         A serene and saintly presence\
           Sanctifies our troubled home.\
         Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\
           Break like ripples on the strand\
         Of the deep and solemn river\
           Where her willing feet now stand.\
\
        "O my sister, passing from me,\
           Out of human care and strife,\
         Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\
           Which have beautified your life.\
         Dear, bequeath me that great patience\
           Which has power to sustain\
         A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\
           In its prison-house of pain.\
\
        "Give me, for I need it sorely,\
           Of that courage, wise and sweet,\
         Which has made the path of duty\
           Green beneath your willing feet.\
         Give me that unselfish nature,\
           That with charity divine\
         Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--\
           Meek heart, forgive me mine!\
\
        "Thus our parting daily loseth\
          Something of its bitter pain,\
         And while learning this hard lesson,\
           My great loss becomes my gain.\
         For the touch of grief will render\
           My wild nature more serene,\
         Give to life new aspirations,\
           A new trust in the unseen.\
\
        "Henceforth, safe across the river,\
           I shall see forevermore\
         A beloved, household spirit\
           Waiting for me on the shore.\
         Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,\
           Guardian angels shall become,\
         And the sister gone before me\
           By their hands shall lead me home."\
\
Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble, as the lines were, they brought\
a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had\
been that she had done so little; and this seemed to assure her that her\
life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the despair\
she feared. As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the\
charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to\
the bedside, hoping Beth slept.\
\
"Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it; I knew\
you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?" she asked, with\
wistful, humble earnestness.\
\
"O Beth, so much, so much!" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow,\
beside her sister's.\
\
"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make\
me, but I _have_ tried to do right; and now, when it's too late to\
begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that some one loves\
me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."\
\
"More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let\
you go; but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you; that you'll be\
more to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to."\
\
"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall\
be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take\
my place, Jo, and be everything to father and mother when I'm gone. They\
will turn to you, don't fail them; and if it's hard to work alone,\
remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing\
that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world; for love is\
the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\
end so easy."\
\
"I'll try, Beth;" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\
pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\
other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\
immortality of love.\
\
So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\
greener, the flowers were up fair and early, and the birds came back in\
time to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung\
to the hands that had led her all her life, as father and mother guided\
her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.\
\
Seldom, except in books, do the dying utter memorable words, see\
visions, or depart with beatified countenances; and those who have sped\
many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and\
simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the "tide went out easily;" and in\
the dark hour before the dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her\
first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\
look, one little sigh.\
\
With tears and prayers and tender hands, mother and sisters made her\
ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\
grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\
patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling, with reverent\
joy, that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\
full of dread.\
\
When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\
Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang\
blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snow-drops blossomed freshly\
at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\
over the placid face upon the pillow,--a face so full of painless peace\
that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God\
that Beth was well at last.\

\
                          LEARNING TO FORGET.\
\
\
Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till\
long afterward; men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, the\
lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded\
themselves that it is just what they intended to do; then they act upon\
it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the credit of\
it; if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back to\
his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the\
old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully,\
and he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman\
would have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back\
after the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the\
longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the\
words that had made the deepest impression, "I despise you;" "Go and do\
something splendid that will _make_ her love you."\
\
Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought\
himself to confess that he _had_ been selfish and lazy; but then when a\
man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries\
till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were\
quite dead now; and, though he should never cease to be a faithful\
mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo\
_wouldn't_ love him, but he might _make_ her respect and admire him by\
doing something which should prove that a girl's "No" had not spoilt his\
life. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite\
unnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted\
affections were decently interred; that being done, he felt that he was\
ready to "hide his stricken heart, and still toil on."\
\
As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie\
resolved to embalm his love-sorrow in music, and compose a Requiem which\
should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore\
the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody,\
and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends,\
and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.\
But, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music\
too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem\
was beyond him, just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in\
working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying; for often in the\
middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing\
tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the\
stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the\
time being.\
\
Then he tried an Opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning;\
but here, again, unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his\
heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender\
recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned\
traitor; and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\
only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\
the most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in\
a bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold\
water over his passion _\'e0 la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh\
spoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be\
put into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a "Bless\
that girl, what a torment she is!" and a clutch at his hair, as became a\
distracted composer.\
\
When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\
immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\
readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,\
was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his\
mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and\
blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he\
took her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;\
for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted\
her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal\
woman.\
\
Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\
gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\
sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas\
and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state\
that winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was\
conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. "It's\
genius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of\
it," he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn't\
genius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to\
some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory\
life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and\
body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved\
music was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas,\
splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\
played a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\
Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\
suddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last\
fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--\
\
"She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That\
music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I\
won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?"\
\
That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\
to work for his daily bread. Now, if ever, occurred an eligible\
opportunity for "going to the devil," as he once forcibly expressed it,\
for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\
fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow\
had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\
them pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\
and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\
to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\
and say "All's well," kept him safe and steady.\
\
Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, "I don't believe it; boys\
will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not\
expect miracles." I dare say _you_ don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true\
nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion\
that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by\
refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the\
better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but\
mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and\
keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing\
that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which\
make men manliest in good women's eyes. If it _is_ a feminine delusion,\
leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and\
the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter\
all our hopes of the brave, tender-hearted little lads, who still love\
their mothers better than themselves, and are not ashamed to own it.\
\
Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb\
all his powers for years; but, to his great surprise, he discovered it\
grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with\
himself, and couldn't understand it; but these hearts of ours are\
curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in\
spite of us. Laurie's heart _wouldn't_ ache; the wound persisted in\
healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and, instead of trying to\
forget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this\
turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with\
himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of\
disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous\
blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but\
they refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow\
that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he\
was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly\
subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and\
resentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a\
brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.\
\
As the word "brotherly" passed through his mind in one of these\
reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was\
before him:--\
\
"Well, he was a great man; and when he couldn't have one sister he took\
the other, and was happy."\
\
Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next\
instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--\
\
"No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if\
that fails, why, then--"\
\
Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\
Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the\
least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let\
him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing,\
but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It\
came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo\
decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\
wished to hear the word "love" again. Then she begged him to be happy\
with somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\
his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\
that Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\
need of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough,\
please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel\
lonely, homesick, or anxious.\
\
"So I will, at once. Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for\
her, I'm afraid;" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\
been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\
before.\
\
But he did not write the letter that day; for, as he rummaged out his\
best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. Tumbling\
about in one part of the desk, among bills, passports, and business\
documents of various kinds, were several of Jo's letters, and in another\
compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her\
blue ribbons, and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away\
inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered\
up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small\
drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his\
finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the\
drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if\
there had been a funeral; and, though not overwhelmed with affliction,\
this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in\
writing letters to charming young ladies.\
\
     [Illustration: Turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger]\
\
The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy\
_was_ homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding\
manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and\
fro, with unfailing regularity, all through the early spring. Laurie\
sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,\
hoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to\
Nice, but would not till he was asked; and Amy would not ask him, for\
just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her\
rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of "our boy."\
\
Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once\
decided to answer "Yes, thank you;" but now she said, "No, thank you,"\
kindly but steadily; for, when the time came, her courage failed her,\
and she found that something more than money and position was needed to\
satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes\
and fears. The words, "Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I\
fancied you would ever like," and Laurie's face when he uttered them,\
kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in\
look, if not in words, "I shall marry for money." It troubled her to\
remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so\
unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly\
creature; she didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as\
she did to be a lovable woman; she was so glad he didn't hate her for\
the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully, and was\
kinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters\
were very irregular, and were not half so satisfactory as his when they\
did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the\
poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being\
stony-hearted. She ought to have made an effort, and tried to love him;\
it couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have\
such a dear boy care for them; but Jo never would act like other girls,\
so there was nothing to do but be very kind, and treat him like a\
brother.\
\
If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they\
would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured\
now; she asked his opinion on all subjects; she was interested in\
everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him\
two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and\
captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are\
complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters'\
pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when\
long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of\
these fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale\
and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went\
out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she\
came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours,\
with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched\
any fancy that occurred to her,--a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a\
young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a\
curly-haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ball-room on the\
arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the\
last fashion in art, which was safe, but not altogether satisfactory.\
\
Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred; and, finding\
denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what\
she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to\
Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he\
said to himself, with a venerable air,--\
\
"I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been\
through it all, and I can sympathize."\
\
With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his\
duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa, and enjoyed Amy's letter\
luxuriously.\
\
While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home; but\
the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the\
next found her, the grass was green above her sister. The sad news met\
her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they\
had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian\
lakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree\
that she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say\
good-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.\
But her heart was very heavy; she longed to be at home, and every day\
looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort\
her.\
\
He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both,\
but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he\
read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow-pedestrians,\
and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow,\
hope and suspense.\
\
He knew Vevay well; and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he\
hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living _en\
pension_. The _gar\'e7on_ was in despair that the whole family had gone to\
take a promenade on the lake; but no, the blond mademoiselle might be in\
the chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting\
down, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait\
even "a flash of time," and, in the middle of the speech, departed to\
find mademoiselle himself.\
\
A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts\
rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the\
tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low\
wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console\
herself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day,\
leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,\
thinking of Beth, and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not\
hear him cross the court-yard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway\
that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute,\
looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen\
before,--the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely\
suggested love and sorrow,--the blotted letters in her lap, the black\
ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face;\
even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for\
he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had\
any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at\
rest the minute she looked up and saw him; for, dropping everything, she\
ran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing,--\
\
"O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"\
\
          [Illustration: O Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come]\
\
I think everything was said and settled then; for, as they stood\
together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down\
protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and\
sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only\
woman in the world who could fill Jo's place, and make him happy. He did\
not tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,\
were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.\
\
In a minute Amy went back to her place; and, while she dried her tears,\
Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry\
well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As\
he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the\
recollection of her impulsive greeting.\
\
"I couldn't help it; I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to\
see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was\
beginning to fear you wouldn't come," she said, trying in vain to speak\
quite naturally.\
\
"I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you\
for the loss of dear little Beth; but I can only feel, and--" He could\
not get any further, for he, too, turned bashful all of a sudden, and\
did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy's head down on his\
shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare; so took\
her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than\
words.\
\
"You needn't say anything; this comforts me," she said softly. "Beth is\
well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back; but I dread the going home,\
much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for it makes\
me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't go right\
back, need you?"\
\
"Not if you want me, dear."\
\
"I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind; but you seem like one of the\
family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while."\
\
Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child, whose heart was full,\
that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what\
she wanted,--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation\
she needed.\
\
"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half-sick! I'm\
going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk\
about with me; the wind is too chilly for you to sit still," he said, in\
the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on\
her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the\
sunny walk, under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon\
his legs; and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean\
upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk\
delightfully for her alone.\
\
The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed\
expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but\
the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of\
their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked\
and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which\
gave such a charm to time and place; and when an unromantic dinner-bell\
warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and\
sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.\
\
The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated\
with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, "Now I understand it\
all,--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I\
never thought of such a thing!"\
\
With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed\
no sign of enlightenment; but cordially urged Laurie to stay, and begged\
Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much\
solitude. Amy was a model of docility; and, as her aunt was a good deal\
occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with\
more than her usual success.\
\
At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded; at Vevay, Laurie was\
never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying, in the\
most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did, and followed\
his example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was\
owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a\
like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.\
\
The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked\
wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer\
views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh\
winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists;\
the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender\
hopes, and happy thoughts; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of\
the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them,\
saying, "Little children, love one another."\
\
In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that\
Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little\
while to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and,\
as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself\
for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost\
the same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been\
impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His\
first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon\
it as if through a long vista of years, with a feeling of compassion\
blended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of\
the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful\
when the pain was over. His second wooing he resolved should be as calm\
and simple as possible; there was no need of having a scene, hardly any\
need of telling Amy that he loved her; she knew it without words, and\
had given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that\
no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even\
Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be\
wary and slow in making a second trial; so Laurie let the days pass,\
enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word\
that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.\
\
He had rather imagined that the _d\'e9nouement_ would take place in the\
chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous\
manner; but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was\
settled on the lake, at noonday, in a few blunt words. They had been\
floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny\
Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the\
Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon\
the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake\
below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged\
gulls.\
\
They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of\
Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his "H\'e9loise."\
Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love-story, and each\
privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had\
been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell\
between them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars,\
with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the\
sake of saying something,--\
\
"You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good;\
for, since you came, I have been altogether lazy and luxurious."\
\
"I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room\
enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't\
trim," returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.\
\
Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third\
of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed\
as well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands,\
and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly\
through the water.\
\
               [Illustration: How well we pull together]\
\
"How well we pull together, don't we?" said Amy, who objected to silence\
just then.\
\
"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,\
Amy?" very tenderly.\
\
"Yes, Laurie," very low.\
\
Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little\
_tableau_ of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected\
in the lake.\
\
\
\
\
                                 XLII.\
\
                               ALL ALONE.\
\
\
It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in\
another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when\
the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved\
presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo\
found her promise very hard to keep. How could she "comfort father and\
mother," when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her\
sister; how could she "make the house cheerful," when all its light and\
warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home\
for the new; and where in all the world could she "find some useful,\
happy work to do," that would take the place of the loving service which\
had been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her\
duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust\
that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life\
get harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all\
sunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair, for she tried more than\
Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble,\
and hard work.\
\
Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came\
over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,\
devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never\
seemed to grow any easier. "I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life\
like this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if\
somebody don't come and help me," she said to herself, when her first\
efforts failed, and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind\
which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.\
\
But some one did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good\
angels at once, because they wore familiar shapes, and used the simple\
spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,\
thinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed\
made her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow, "O Beth,\
come back! come back!" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in\
vain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her\
sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with\
words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears\
that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken\
whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went\
hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to\
heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,\
which chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden\
seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more\
endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.\
\
When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found\
help; for one day she went to the study, and, leaning over the good gray\
head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very\
humbly,--\
\
"Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for\
I'm all wrong."\
\
"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this," he answered, with a falter\
in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and\
did not fear to ask it.\
\
                   [Illustration: Jo and her father]\
\
Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her\
troubles,--the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that\
discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all\
the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire\
confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation\
in the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only\
as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve\
each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,\
thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called "the church of\
one member," and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered\
cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had\
taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach\
another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its\
beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.\
\
Other helps had Jo,--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would\
not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to\
see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as\
they once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of\
her housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old\
brush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself\
humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and\
giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and\
cosey, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she\
didn't know it, till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the\
hand,--\
\
"You thoughtful creter, you're determined we sha'n't miss that dear lamb\
ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the Lord will\
bless you for't, see ef He don't."\
\
As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister\
Meg was; how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly\
impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and\
children, and how much they were all doing for each other.\
\
"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom\
out half as well as you have, if I tried it?" said Jo, as she\
constructed a kite for Demi, in the topsy-turvy nursery.\
\
"It's just what you need to bring out the tender, womanly half of your\
nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut-burr, prickly outside, but\
silky-soft within, and a sweet kernel, if one can only get at it. Love\
will make you show your heart some day, and then the rough burr will\
fall off."\
\
"Frost opens chestnut-burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring\
them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,"\
returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would\
ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.\
\
Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but\
she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her\
power; and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of\
Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.\
Grief is the best opener for some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for\
the bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's\
impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the\
burr, and find the kernel sound and sweet. If she had suspected this,\
she would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever;\
fortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so, when the time came,\
down she dropped.\
\
Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral story-book, she ought at\
this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the\
world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in\
her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine; she was only a struggling\
human girl, like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature,\
being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It's\
highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once,\
and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,\
before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so\
far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did\
not; but to do it cheerfully--ah, that was another thing! She had often\
said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard; and now\
she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her\
life to father and mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they\
had to her? And, if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor\
of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than\
to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for\
others?\
\
Providence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she\
had expected, but better, because self had no part in it: now, could she\
do it? She decided that she would try; and, in her first attempt, she\
found the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she\
took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the\
refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed\
the hill called Difficulty.\
\
"Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy," said her\
mother, once, when the desponding fit overshadowed Jo.\
\
"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things."\
\
"We do; write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.\
Try it, dear; I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much."\
\
"Don't believe I can;" but Jo got out her desk, and began to overhaul\
her half-finished manuscripts.\
\
An hour afterward her mother peeped in, and there she was, scratching\
away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which\
caused Mrs. March to smile, and slip away, well pleased with the success\
of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into\
that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it; for,\
when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much\
against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and, to her utter\
surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from\
several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the\
little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends\
admired it. For a small thing it was a great success; and Jo was more\
astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.\
\
"I don't understand it. What _can_ there be in a simple little story\
like that, to make people praise it so?" she said, quite bewildered.\
\
"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret; humor and pathos make it\
alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thought\
of fame or money, and put your heart into it, my daughter; you have had\
the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we\
are in your success."\
\
"If there _is_ anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine; I\
owe it all to you and mother and to Beth," said Jo, more touched by her\
father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.\
\
So, taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent\
them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very\
charitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly\
welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful\
children whom good fortune overtakes.\
\
When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo\
would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set\
at rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly,\
and was full of hopes and plans for "the children" before she read the\
letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the\
other in lover-like fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to\
think of, for no one had any objection to make.\
\
"You like it, mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written\
sheets, and looked at one another.\
\
"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused\
Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the\
'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her\
letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day."\
\
"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to\
me."\
\
"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have\
girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest\
you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled."\
\
"I'm not the scatter-brain I was; you may trust me, I'm sober and\
sensible enough for any one's _confidante_ now."\
\
"So you are, dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it\
might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved any one else."\
\
"Now, mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,\
after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?"\
\
"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he\
came back, and asked again, you might, perhaps, feel like giving another\
answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely,\
and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart;\
so I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now."\
\
"No, mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to love\
him. But you are right in one thing: I _am_ lonely, and perhaps if Teddy\
had tried again, I might have said 'Yes,' not because I love him any\
more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away."\
\
"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are\
plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother,\
sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all\
comes to give you your reward."\
\
"Mothers are the _best_ lovers in the world; but I don't mind whispering\
to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the\
more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the\
more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many; mine is\
so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented\
with my family. I don't understand it."\
\
"I do;" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the\
leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.\
\
"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me; he isn't\
sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he\
says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem\
to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender\
he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of\
noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's\
mine. He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage now\
with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may,\
and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all\
my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets\
us be together. O mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world\
could be, when two people love and live for one another!"\
\
"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work\
miracles. How very, very happy they must be!" And Jo laid the rustling\
sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a\
lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he\
finds himself alone in the work-a-day world again.\
\
By and by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not\
walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,\
not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one\
sister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true;\
she knew that, and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for\
affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for\
some one to "love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them\
be together."\
\
Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended, stood four little\
wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each\
filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo\
glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the\
edge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of\
old exercise-books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over,\
and re-lived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled\
at first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a\
little message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to\
tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the\
friendly words, as if they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot\
in her heart.\
\
"Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely\
come."\
\
"Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my\
dear old Fritz, I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now\
how I should love to see him, for every one seems going away from me,\
and I'm all alone."\
\
And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be\
fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag-bag, and cried, as\
if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.\
\
  [Illustration: Jo laid her head on a comfortable rag-bag and cried]\
\
Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? or was it the waking\
up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer?\
Who shall say?\
\
\
\
\
     [Illustration: A substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her]\
\
                                 XLIII.\
\
                               SURPRISES.\
\
\
Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the\
fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of\
dusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little\
red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender\
thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired,\
grave, and rather sad; for to-morrow was her birthday, and she was\
thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how\
little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing\
to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show,\
and by and by she saw, and was grateful for it.\
\
"An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for\
a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a\
morsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old, and can't\
enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.\
Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner; and, I dare say,\
old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it; but--" and\
there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.\
\
It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to\
five-and-twenty; but it's not so bad as it looks, and one can get on\
quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon. At\
twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly\
resolve that they never will be; at thirty they say nothing about it,\
but quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by\
remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which\
they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the\
spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragical romances are\
hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,\
and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make\
the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters\
should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part\
of life, if for no other reason; and, looking at them with compassion,\
not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may\
miss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver\
threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by and by,\
kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.\
\
Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter\
how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that\
which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,\
and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect\
the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and\
petted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out\
of, the "tips" they have given you from their small store, the stitches\
the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet\
have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions\
that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls\
are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them;\
and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,\
should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and\
maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest\
corner of her lonely old heart for the "the best nevvy in the world."\
\
Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this\
little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before\
her,--a substantial, lifelike ghost,--leaning over her, with the very\
look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show\
it. But, like Jenny in the ballad,--\
\
        "She could not think it he,"\
\
and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and\
kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully,--\
\
"O my Teddy! O my Teddy!"\
\
"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"\
\
"Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?"\
\
"Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and\
there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."\
\
"Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an\
unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.\
\
"Oh, the dickens! now I've done it;" and he looked so guilty that Jo was\
down upon him like a flash.\
\
"You've gone and got married!"\
\
"Yes, please, but I never will again;" and he went down upon his knees,\
with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,\
and triumph.\
\
"Actually married?"\
\
"Very much so, thank you."\
\
"Mercy on us! What dreadful thing will you do next?" and Jo fell into\
her seat, with a gasp.\
\
"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,"\
returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with\
satisfaction.\
\
"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like\
a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you\
ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."\
\
"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to\
barricade."\
\
Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted\
the sofa invitingly, as she said, in a cordial tone,--\
\
"The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now; so, come and\
'fess, Teddy."\
\
"How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that\
but you;" and Laurie sat down, with an air of great content.\
\
"What does Amy call you?"\
\
"My lord."\
\
"That's like her. Well, you look it;" and Jo's eyes plainly betrayed\
that she found her boy comelier than ever.\
\
The pillow was gone, but there _was_ a barricade, nevertheless,--a\
natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it,\
and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast\
a little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie\
said, with a vain attempt at dignity,--\
\
"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"\
\
"Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you\
are the same scapegrace as ever."\
\
"Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect," began\
Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.\
\
"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so\
irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo, smiling all\
over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then\
settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.\
\
"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all\
coming up presently. I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you\
the grand surprise, and have 'first skim,' as we used to say when we\
squabbled about the cream."\
\
"Of course you did, and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end.\
Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened; I'm pining to know."\
\
"Well, I did it to please Amy," began Laurie, with a twinkle that made\
Jo exclaim,--\
\
"Fib number one; Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if\
you can, sir."\
\
"Now she's beginning to marm it; isn't it jolly to hear her?" said\
Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite\
agreed. "It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to\
come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly\
changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But\
grandpa wanted to come home; he went to please me, and I couldn't let\
him go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had got English\
notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come\
with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be married,\
and then we can do as we like.'"\
\
"Of course you did; you always have things to suit you."\
\
"Not always;" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily,--\
\
"How did you ever get aunt to agree?"\
\
"It was hard work; but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps\
of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,\
but you all liked it, had consented to it by and by, and it was only\
'taking Time by the fetlock,' as my wife says."\
\
"Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?"\
interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with\
delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so\
tragically gloomy when she saw them last.\
\
"A trifle, perhaps; she's such a captivating little woman I can't help\
being proud of her. Well, then, uncle and aunt were there to play\
propriety; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use\
apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all\
round; so we did it."\
\
"When, where, how?" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and\
curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.\
\
"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris; a very quiet\
wedding, of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear\
little Beth."\
\
Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the\
little red pillow, which he remembered well.\
\
"Why didn't you let us know afterward?" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,\
when they had sat quite still a minute.\
\
"We wanted to surprise you; we thought we were coming directly home, at\
first; but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he\
couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our\
honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular\
honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but\
once in their lives. My faith! wasn't it love among the roses!"\
\
Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it; for the\
fact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her\
that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her\
hand; but, as if he guessed the thought that prompted the\
half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly\
gravity she had never seen in him before,--\
\
"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever. As\
I told you in my letter, when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I\
never shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned\
to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you change places in my\
heart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come\
about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never\
could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong\
and violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it\
_was_ one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of\
myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that\
I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both\
alike; but I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything\
seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and\
I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with\
the new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife\
Amy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the\
happy old times when we first knew one another?"\
\
"I'll believe it, with all my heart; but, Teddy, we never can be boy and\
girl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect\
it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is\
over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this; I see the\
change in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I\
shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be\
what I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we\
will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives,\
won't we, Laurie?"\
\
He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his\
face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish\
passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them\
both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home\
to be a sad one,--\
\
"I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to\
set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning\
Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how\
time does fly!"\
\
"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like\
a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed,' as Peggotty said\
of David; and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious\
infant," said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.\
\
"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in\
feeling, Teddy. Women always are; and this last year has been such a\
hard one that I feel forty."\
\
"Poor Jo! we left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You\
_are_ older; here's a line, and there's another; unless you smile, your\
eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear\
on it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.\
What a selfish beast I've been!" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a\
remorseful look.\
\
But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone\
which she tried to make quite cheerful,--\
\
"No, I had father and mother to help me, the dear babies to comfort me,\
and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the\
troubles here easier to bear. I _am_ lonely, sometimes, but I dare say\
it's good for me, and--"\
\
"You never shall be again," broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,\
as if to fence out every human ill. "Amy and I can't get on without\
you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go\
halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all\
be blissfully happy and friendly together."\
\
"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to\
feel quite young already; for, somehow, all my troubles seemed to fly\
away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy;" and Jo leaned her\
head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill, and\
Laurie told her to hold on to him.\
\
He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was\
smiling to herself, as if, in truth, her troubles _had_ all vanished at\
his coming.\
\
"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and\
laughing the next. You look a little wicked now; what is it, grandma?"\
\
"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."\
\
"Like angels!"\
\
"Yes, of course, at first; but which rules?"\
\
"I don't mind telling you that she does, now; at least I let her think\
so,--it pleases her, you know. By and by we shall take turns, for\
marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties."\
\
"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your\
life."\
\
"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind\
much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well; in fact, I\
rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and\
prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you\
a favor all the while."\
\
"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying\
it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.\
\
It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine\
scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his "high and mighty"\
air,--\
\
"Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of man to submit\
to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to\
tyrannize or quarrel."\
\
Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy\
seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her\
pleasure.\
\
"I am sure of that; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is\
the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best,\
you remember."\
\
"She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie. "Such a\
lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than\
any of your scoldings,--a regular rouser. I'll tell you all about it\
sometime,--_she_ never will, because, after telling me that she despised\
and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and\
married the good-for-nothing."\
\
"What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend\
you."\
\
"I look as if I needed it, don't I?" said Laurie, getting up and\
striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the\
rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling,--\
\
"Where is she? Where's my dear old Jo?"\
\
In trooped the whole family, and every one was hugged and kissed all\
over again, and, after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were\
set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty\
as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour,\
for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned\
courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It\
was good to see him beam at "my children," as he called the young pair;\
it was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection\
which completely won his old heart; and best of all, to watch Laurie\
revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture\
they made.\
\
The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own\
dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely\
eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that "her ladyship" was altogether\
a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair,\
"How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the\
beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy\
old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him." Mrs. March and her\
husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw\
that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the\
better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.\
\
For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful\
heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage\
was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little\
affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more\
charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at\
once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to\
become.\
\
"Love has done much for our little girl," said her mother softly.\
\
"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear," Mr. March\
whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside\
him.\
\
Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her "pitty aunty," but\
attached herself like a lap-dog to the wonderful ch\'e2telaine full of\
delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before\
he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the\
tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement\
produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to\
have him.\
\
"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you\
hit me in the face: now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman;" and\
with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew\
in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted\
his boyish soul.\
\
  [Illustration: The tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small\
                                nephew]\
\
"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot? Ain't it a relishin'\
sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks\
calling little Amy, Mis. Laurence?" muttered old Hannah, who could not\
resist frequent "peeks" through the slide as she set the table in a most\
decidedly promiscuous manner.\
\
Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all\
burst out together, trying to tell the history of three years in half an\
hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and\
provide refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they\
had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the\
little dining-room! Mr. March proudly escorted "Mrs. Laurence;" Mrs.\
March as proudly leaned on the arm of "my son;" the old gentleman took\
Jo, with a whispered "You must be my girl now," and a glance at the\
empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, with trembling\
lips, "I'll try to fill her place, sir."\
\
The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for\
every one was so busy with the new-comers that they were left to revel\
at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the\
opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread _ab\
libitum_, get a hot biscuit apiece, and, as a crowning trespass, didn't\
they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there\
to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature\
and pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the\
sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the\
thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little\
sinners attached themselves to "Dranpa," who hadn't his spectacles on.\
Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on\
Father Laurence's arm; the others paired off as before, and this\
arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute,\
for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry,--\
\
"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (_coup\'e9_), and use all them lovely\
silver dishes that's stored away over yander?"\
\
"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and\
wore diamonds and point-lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good\
for her," returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.\
\
"No more there is! Will you have hash or fish-balls for breakfast?"\
asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.\
\
"I don't care;" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an\
uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party\
vanishing above, and, as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last\
stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she\
looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,\
for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was\
coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to\
herself, "I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed; it won't do to be\
dismal now." Then she drew her hand over her eyes,--for one of her\
boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was,--and had\
just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the\
porch-door.\
\
She opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had\
come to surprise her; for there stood a tall, bearded gentleman, beaming\
on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.\
\
"O Mr. Bhaer, I _am_ so glad to see you!" cried Jo, with a clutch, as if\
she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.\
\
          [Illustration: O Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you]\
\
"And I to see Miss Marsch,--but no, you haf a party--" and the Professor\
paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to\
them.\
\
"No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come\
home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us."\
\
Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously\
away, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the\
door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had\
something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,\
and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary\
man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.\
\
"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You\
haf been ill, my friend?"\
\
He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light\
fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.\
\
"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you\
last."\
\
"Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that;" and he\
shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no\
comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,\
warm hand.\
\
"Father, mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer," she said, with a\
face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as\
well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.\
\
If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception, they were set at\
rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Every one greeted\
him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his\
own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all\
hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the\
more friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those who live\
above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer\
sat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a\
strange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children\
went to him like bees to a honey-pot; and, establishing themselves on\
each knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling\
his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The\
women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling\
that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his\
guest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but\
said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.\
\
If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have\
amused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like\
suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe\
the new-comer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.\
He got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn\
into the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,\
and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him\
often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own\
lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would\
turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute\
inquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had her own eyes to take care of,\
and, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on\
the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.\
\
A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water\
after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious\
omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and\
looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and\
handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she\
usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite\
inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the\
conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.\
Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and\
thought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, "How he\
would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!"\
Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him\
look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and\
smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for, in exciting\
moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked\
it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his\
fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that\
plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing\
escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold\
sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands!\
\
"Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd\
been going a-wooing," said Jo to herself; and then a sudden thought,\
born of the words, made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her\
ball, and go down after it to hide her face.\
\
The man\'9cuvre did not succeed as well as she expected, however; for,\
though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral-pile, the Professor\
dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the\
little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,\
saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to\
resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.\
\
Nobody knew where the evening went to; for Hannah skilfully abstracted\
the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.\
Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking\
away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal\
mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of\
bed, and Demi set his night-gown afire studying the structure of\
matches, made a move to go.\
\
"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together\
again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and\
pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.\
\
They were not _all_ there. But no one found the words thoughtless or\
untrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,\
invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the\
household league that love made indissoluble. The little chair stood in\
its old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished\
when the needle grew "so heavy," was still on its accustomed shelf; the\
beloved instrument, seldom touched now, had not been moved; and above it\
Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon\
them, seeming to say, "Be happy. I am here."\
\
"Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved," said\
Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.\
\
But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool,--\
\
"Not to-night, dear. I can't show off to-night."\
\
But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill; for she sung\
Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master\
could not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter\
power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very\
still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's\
favorite hymn. It was hard to say,--\
\
        "Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;"\
\
and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that\
her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.\
\
"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song; for Mr. Bhaer sings that," said\
Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with\
a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood,\
saying,--\
\
"You will sing with me? We go excellently well together."\
\
A pleasing fiction, by the way; for Jo had no more idea of music than a\
grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a\
whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.\
It didn't much matter; for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily\
and well; and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen\
to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.\
\
                [Illustration: Mr. Bhaer sang heartily]\
\
        "Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,"\
\
used to be the Professor's favorite line, for "das land" meant Germany\
to him; but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,\
upon the words,--\
\
        "There, oh there, might I with thee,\
         O my beloved, go!"\
\
and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she\
longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither\
whenever he liked.\
\
The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered\
with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners\
entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been\
introduced simply as "my sister," and no one had called her by her new\
name since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in\
his most gracious manner, at parting,--\
\
"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that\
there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."\
\
Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly\
illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most\
delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.\
\
"I too shall go; but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me\
leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here\
some days."\
\
He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave\
as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes; for Mrs. March was not\
so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.\
\
"I suspect that is a wise man," remarked Mr. March, with placid\
satisfaction, from the hearth-rug, after the last guest had gone.\
\
"I know he is a good one," added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as\
she wound up the clock.\
\
"I thought you'd like him," was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her\
bed.\
\
She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,\
and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,\
somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen\
his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a\
severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to\
be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the\
subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture\
in the dark.\

\
                           MY LORD AND LADY.\
\
\
"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The\
luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery, trying\
to find some things I want," said Laurie, coming in the next day to find\
Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made "the baby"\
again.\
\
"Certainly. Go, dear; I forget that you have any home but this," and\
Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding-ring, as if\
asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.\
\
"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it; but I can't get\
on without my little woman any more than a--"\
\
"Weathercock can without wind," suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile;\
Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.\
\
"Exactly; for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only\
an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an easterly\
spell since I was married; don't know anything about the north, but am\
altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?"\
\
"Lovely weather so far; I don't know how long it will last, but I'm not\
afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear,\
and I'll find your bootjack; I suppose that's what you are rummaging\
after among my things. Men are _so_ helpless, mother," said Amy, with a\
matronly air, which delighted her husband.\
\
"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?" asked\
Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.\
\
"We have our plans; we don't mean to say much about them yet, because we\
are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into\
business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to\
him that I'm not spoilt. I need something of the sort to keep me steady.\
I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man."\
\
"And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at\
Laurie's decision, and the energy with which he spoke.\
\
"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall\
astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant\
society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall\
exert over the world at large. That's about it, isn't it, Madame\
R\'e9camier?" asked Laurie, with a quizzical look at Amy.\
\
"Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by\
calling me names before their faces," answered Amy, resolving that there\
should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a _salon_ as a\
queen of society.\
\
"How happy those children seem together!" observed Mr. March, finding it\
difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had\
gone.\
\
"Yes, and I think it will last," added Mrs. March, with the restful\
expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.\
\
"I know it will. Happy Amy!" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as\
Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.\
\
Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the\
bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, who was flitting about,\
arranging her new art treasures,--\
\
"Mrs. Laurence."\
\
"My lord!"\
\
"That man intends to marry our Jo!"\
\
"I hope so; don't you, dear?"\
\
"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that\
expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal\
richer."\
\
"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love\
one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.\
Women _never_ should marry for money--" Amy caught herself up short as\
the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with\
malicious gravity,--\
\
"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend\
to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your\
duty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a\
good-for-nothing like me."\
\
"O my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I\
said 'Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes\
wish you _were_ poor that I might show how much I love you;" and Amy,\
who was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave\
convincing proofs of the truth of her words.\
\
"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be\
once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd\
gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your\
living by rowing on the lake."\
\
"Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a\
richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I\
have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to\
think it is their only salvation; but you had better lessons, and,\
though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the\
daughter was true to the mother's teaching. I told mamma so yesterday,\
and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a\
million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral\
remarks, Mrs. Laurence;" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an absent\
look, though fixed upon his face.\
\
"Yes, I am, and admiring the dimple in your chin at the same time. I\
don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my\
handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is\
_such_ a comfort to me;" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature\
with artistic satisfaction.\
\
Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that\
suited him better, as he plainly showed, though he did laugh at his\
wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly,--\
\
"May I ask you a question, dear?"\
\
"Of course you may."\
\
"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"\
\
"Oh, that's the trouble, is it? I thought there was something in the\
dimple that didn't suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the\
happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding with a\
heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?"\
\
Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied; her last little jealous fear\
vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and\
confidence.\
\
"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't\
we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in\
Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said Laurie, when they\
began to pace up and down the long drawing-room, arm-in-arm, as they\
were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.\
\
             [Illustration: They began to pace up and down]\
\
"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all; she is very proud of him, just\
as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful\
thing."\
\
"Bless her dear heart! she won't think so when she has a literary\
husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We\
won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in\
spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she\
believes in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her in\
that way."\
\
"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was\
always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely; and, thanks\
to you, the dream has come true."\
\
"Ah! we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of poverty\
that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of,\
but poor gentlefolks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people\
don't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping\
them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not\
offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a\
blarneying beggar; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it is\
harder."\
\
"Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other member of the\
domestic admiration society.\
\
"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I was\
going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many\
talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real\
hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some\
of them, working like heroes, poor and friendless, but so full of\
courage, patience, and ambition, that I was ashamed of myself, and\
longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it's a\
satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be\
allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of\
fuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven't, it's a pleasure to\
comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it\
out."\
\
"Yes, indeed; and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer in\
silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a\
princess of me, as the king does the beggar-maid in the old story.\
Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth,\
health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help\
at the right minute. People have been very kind to me; and whenever I\
see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand\
and help them, as I was helped."\
\
"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie, resolving,\
with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for\
the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. "Rich\
people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their\
money accumulate for others to waste. It's not half so sensible to leave\
legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and\
enjoy making one's fellow-creatures happy with it. We'll have a good\
time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving\
other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about\
emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds?"\
\
"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping, as you\
ride gallantly through the world, to share your cloak with the beggar."\
\
"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"\
\
So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,\
feeling that their pleasant home was more home-like because they hoped\
to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more\
uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough\
ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely\
knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest\
than they.\

\
                            DAISY AND DEMI.\
\
\
I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March\
family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious\
and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of\
discretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their\
rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do.\
If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by\
adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most\
remarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they\
walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two\
years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety\
which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a "needler," and\
actually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up\
housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking-stove\
with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi\
learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of\
teaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs,\
thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a\
mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother,\
for he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a\
chaotic condition, with his "sewin-sheen,"--a mysterious structure of\
string, chairs, clothes-pins, and spools, for wheels to go "wound and\
wound;" also a basket hung over the back of a big chair, in which he\
vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine\
devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the\
young inventor indignantly remarked, "Why, marmar, dat's my lellywaiter,\
and me's trying to pull her up."\
\
Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well\
together, and seldom quarrelled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi\
tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other\
aggressor; while Daisy made a galley-slave of herself, and adored her\
brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny\
little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and\
nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be\
kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and\
produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small\
virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few\
small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair\
weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window\
in her little night-gown to look out, and say, no matter whether it\
rained or shone, "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Every one was a friend,\
and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most\
inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful\
worshippers.\
\
                   [Illustration: Me loves evvybody]\
\
"Me loves evvybody," she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in\
one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish\
the whole world.\
\
As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dove-cote would be blest\
by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had\
helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared\
a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had\
entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her "Beth,"\
and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if\
trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could\
see.\
\
Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know\
everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get\
satisfactory answers to his perpetual "What for?"\
\
He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his\
grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which\
the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised\
satisfaction of the womenfolk.\
\
             [Illustration: What makes my legs go, dranpa?]\
\
"What makes my legs go, dranpa?" asked the young philosopher, surveying\
those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting\
after a go-to-bed frolic one night.\
\
"It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the yellow\
head respectfully.\
\
"What is a little mine?"\
\
"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the\
wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."\
\
"Open me; I want to see it go wound."\
\
"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you\
up, and you go till He stops you."\
\
"Does I?" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the\
new thought. "Is I wounded up like the watch?"\
\
"Yes; but I can't show you how; for it is done when we don't see."\
\
Demi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the\
watch, and then gravely remarked,--\
\
"I dess Dod does it when I's asleep."\
\
A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that\
his anxious grandmother said,--\
\
"My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby?\
He's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most\
unanswerable questions."\
\
"If he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive\
true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping\
him unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,\
and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.\
Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind?"\
\
If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, "By the gods, Socrates, I cannot\
tell," his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after\
standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he\
answered, in a tone of calm conviction, "In my little belly," the old\
gentleman could only join in grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in\
metaphysics.\
\
There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given\
convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding\
philosopher; for, often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to\
prophesy, with ominous nods, "That child ain't long for this world," he\
would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with\
which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their\
parents' souls.\
\
Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them; but what mother was\
ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the\
tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show\
themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?\
\
"No more raisins, Demi, they'll make you sick," says mamma to the young\
person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity\
on plum-pudding day.\
\
"Me likes to be sick."\
\
"I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty-cakes."\
\
He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit; and, by\
and by, when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits mamma by a\
shrewd bargain.\
\
"Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like," says\
Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is\
safely bouncing in the pot.\
\
"Truly, marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered\
head.\
\
"Yes, truly; anything you say," replies the short-sighted parent,\
preparing herself to sing "The Three Little Kittens" half a dozen times\
over, or to take her family to "Buy a penny bun," regardless of wind or\
limb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply,--\
\
"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."\
\
Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and _confidante_ of both children, and the\
trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a\
name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but\
Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which\
compliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo\
neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their\
little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost\
her best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration,\
soon discovered that Dodo liked to play with "the bear-man" better than\
she did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he\
hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate-drops in\
his waistcoat-pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case\
and freely shaken by ardent admirers.\
\
Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;\
but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the\
"bear-man" with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small\
affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her\
throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.\
\
Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the\
young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this\
counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not\
deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however\
likewise effective,--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law;\
he was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked\
particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his\
manly one. His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day,\
but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked\
for Mr. March, so I suppose _he_ was the attraction. The excellent papa\
labored under the delusion that he was, and revelled in long discussions\
with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing\
grandson suddenly enlightened him.\
\
Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,\
astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay\
Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,\
likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own\
short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovellers so seriously absorbed\
that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his\
sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face,--\
\
"Father, father, here's the Professor!"\
\
Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor\
said, with undisturbed dignity,--\
\
"Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing\
our lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name."\
\
"I knows him!" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took\
the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly\
shouted, "It's a We, dranpa, it's a We!"\
\
                   [Illustration: Dranpa, it's a We]\
\
"He's a born Weller," laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and\
her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing\
his satisfaction that school was over.\
\
"What have you been at to-day, b\'fcbchen?" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the\
gymnast.\
\
"Me went to see little Mary."\
\
"And what did you there?"\
\
"I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.\
\
"Prut! thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?"\
asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon\
his knee, exploring the waistcoat-pocket.\
\
"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. _Don't_ little\
boys like little girls?" added Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of\
bland satisfaction.\
\
"You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?" said Jo, enjoying\
the innocent revelations as much as the Professor.\
\
"'Tisn't in mine head; it's in mine mouf," answered literal Demi,\
putting out his tongue, with a chocolate-drop on it, thinking she\
alluded to confectionery, not ideas.\
\
"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet,\
mannling;" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her\
wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw\
the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired,--\
\
"Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor?"\
\
Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer "couldn't tell a lie;" so he gave the\
somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that\
made Mr. March put down his clothes-brush, glance at Jo's retiring face,\
and then sink into his chair, looking as if the "precocious chick" had\
put an idea into _his_ head that was both sweet and sour.\
\
Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china-closet half an hour\
afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a\
tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she\

of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled\
his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.\

\
                                 XLVI.\
\
                          UNDER THE UMBRELLA.\
\
\
While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,\
as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.\
Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy\
roads and sodden fields.\
\
"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should\
give it up, just because I often happen to meet the Professor on his way\
out," said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters; for, though\
there were two paths to Meg's, whichever one she took she was sure to\
meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and\
never seemed to see her till quite close, when he would look as if his\
short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till\
that moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's, he always had something\
for the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled\
down to see the river, and was just about returning, unless they were\
tired of his frequent calls.\
\
Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and\
invite him in? If she _was_ tired of his visits, she concealed her\
weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee\
for supper, "as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea."\
\
By the second week, every one knew perfectly well what was going on, yet\
every one tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in\
Jo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair\
three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no\
one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while\
talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in\
love.\
\
Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried\
to quench her feelings; and, failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated\
life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,\
after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her\
especial dread; but, thanks to the new manager, he behaved with\
praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer "a capital old fellow" in\
public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved\
appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's\
hat on the Marches' hall-table nearly every evening. But he exulted in\
private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of\
plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate\
coat-of-arms.\
\
For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity;\
then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign,--a\
proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become\
pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance!--very cross.\
\
"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's\
nothing to me, of course; but I _should_ think he would have come and\
bid us good-by, like a gentleman," she said to herself, with a\
despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary\
walk, one dull afternoon.\
\
"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear; it looks like rain," said\
her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding\
to the fact.\
\
"Yes, Marmee; do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get\
some paper," returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the\
glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.\
\
"Yes; I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and\
two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on,\
and something warm under your cloak?"\
\
"I believe so," answered Jo absently.\
\
"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to\
see the dear man," added Mrs. March.\
\
Jo heard _that_, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk\
rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her\
heartache,--\
\
"How good she is to me! What _do_ girls do who haven't any mothers to\
help them through their troubles?"\
\
The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, and\
wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate; but Jo found\
herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand,\
loitering along as if waiting for some one, examining engineering\
instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most\
unfeminine interest; tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by\
descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as\
if they wondered "how the deuce she got there." A drop of rain on her\
cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons; for\
the drops continued to fall, and, being a woman as well as a lover, she\
felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her\
bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten\
to take in her hurry to be off; but regret was unavailing, and nothing\
could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at\
the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black,\
forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at\
a certain grimy warehouse, with "Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co." over the door,\
and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air,--\
\
"It serves me right! What business had I to put on all my best things\
and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm\
ashamed of you! No, you shall _not_ go there to borrow an umbrella, or\
find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do\
your errands in the rain; and if you catch your death and ruin your\
bonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!"\
\
With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly\
escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into\
the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, "I beg pardon, ma'am,"\
and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself,\
spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and, putting\
temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the\
ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a\
somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected\
bonnet, attracted her attention; and, looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer\
looking down.\
\
              [Illustration: Looking up she saw Mr. Bhaer]\
\
"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many\
horse-noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my\
friend?"\
\
"I'm shopping."\
\
Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle-factory on one side, to\
the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other; but he only said\
politely,--\
\
"You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles?"\
\
"Yes, thank you."\
\
Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought\
of her; but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking\
away arm-in-arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly\
burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,\
and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that\
day.\
\
"We thought you had gone," said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking\
at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared he\
might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.\
\
"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been\
so heavenly kind to me?" he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if\
she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily,--\
\
"No, _I_ didn't; I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we\
rather missed you,--father and mother especially."\
\
"And you?"\
\
"I'm always glad to see you, sir."\
\
In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and\
the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the Professor,\
for his smile vanished, as he said gravely,--\
\
"I thank you, and come one time more before I go."\
\
"You _are_ going, then?"\
\
"I haf no longer any business here; it is done."\
\
"Successfully, I hope?" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment\
was in that short reply of his.\
\
"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make\
my bread and gif my J\'fcnglings much help."\
\
"Tell me, please! I like to know all about the--the boys," said Jo\
eagerly.\
\
"That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in\
a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way\
smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I not?"\
\
"Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you\
like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!" cried Jo, clinging to\
the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.\
\
"Ah! but we shall not meet often, I fear; this place is at the West."\
\
"So far away!" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't\
matter now what became of her clothes or herself.\
\
Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read\
women yet. He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,\
therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner,\
which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a\
dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When she met him\
she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that\
she had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she\
took it with a look that filled him with delight; but when he asked if\
she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell\
upon him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands: was\
the joy all for the boys? Then, on hearing his destination, she said,\
"So far away!" in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of\
hope; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like\
one entirely absorbed in the matter,--\
\
"Here's the place for my errands; will you come in? It won't take long."\
\
Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and\
particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and despatch\
with which she would accomplish the business. But, owing to the flutter\
she was in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot\
the silesia was to be "twilled" till it was cut off, gave the wrong\
change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon\
at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and\
blunder; and, as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside,\
for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women, like dreams,\
go by contraries.\
\
When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful\
aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it, on\
the whole.\
\
"Should we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and\
haf a farewell feast to-night if I go for my last call at your so\
pleasant home?" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and\
flowers.\
\
"What will we buy?" said Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech, and\
sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went\
in.\
\
"May they haf oranges and figs?" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.\
\
"They eat them when they can get them."\
\
"Do you care for nuts?"\
\
"Like a squirrel."\
\
"Hamburg grapes; yes, we shall surely drink to the Fatherland in those?"\
\
Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy\
a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and done with\
it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and\
finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy\
daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a\
demijohn. Then, distorting his pockets with the knobby bundles, and\
giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they\
travelled on again.\
\
"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you," began the Professor,\
after a moist promenade of half a block.\
\
"Yes, sir;" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would\
hear it.\
\
"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time\
remains to me."\
\
"Yes, sir;" and Jo nearly crushed the small flower-pot with the sudden\
squeeze she gave it.\
\
"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go\
alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"\
\
"Yes, sir;" and Jo felt as calm and cool, all of a sudden, as if she had\
stepped into a refrigerator.\
\
"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and\
the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a\
friendly thing to take the little mother."\
\
"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going very fast and he's\
getting dearer every minute," added Jo to herself; then, with a mental\
shake, she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant\
to behold.\
\
Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and\
then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man,\
condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be\
shopping for their family.\
\
"Your lady may prefer this; it's a superior article, a most desirable\
color, quite chaste and genteel," he said, shaking out a comfortable\
gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.\
\
             [Illustration: Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?]\
\
"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?" she asked, turning her back to him,\
and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.\
\
"Excellently well; we will haf it," answered the Professor, smiling to\
himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters\
like a confirmed bargain-hunter.\
\
"Now shall we go home?" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to\
him.\
\
"Yes; it's late, and I'm _so_ tired." Jo's voice was more pathetic than\
she knew; for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came\
out, the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time\
she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her\
heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr.\
Bhaer was going away; he only cared for her as a friend; it was all a\
mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her\
head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that\
the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.\
\
"This is not our omniboos," said the Professor, waving the loaded\
vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.\
\
"I beg your pardon, I didn't see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can\
walk. I'm used to plodding in the mud," returned Jo, winking hard,\
because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.\
\
Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away;\
the sight seemed to touch him very much, for, suddenly stooping down, he\
asked in a tone that meant a great deal,--\
\
"Heart's dearest, why do you cry?"\
\
Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said\
she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine\
fib proper to the occasion; instead of which that undignified creature\
answered, with an irrepressible sob,--\
\
"Because you are going away."\
\
"Ach, mein Gott, that is _so_ good!" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp\
his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles. "Jo, I haf nothing\
but much love to gif you; I came to see if you could care for it, and I\
waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I? Can\
you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?" he added, all in\
one breath.\
\
"Oh, yes!" said Jo; and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both\
hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly\
showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even\
though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried\
it.\
\
It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for, even if he had\
desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account\
of the mud; neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for\
both were full; much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in\
the open street, though he was near it: so the only way in which he\
could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which\
glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be\
little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not\
loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done it _then_, for she\
looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her\
rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately,\
Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found\
him more "Jove-like" than ever, though his hat-brim was quite limp with\
the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the\
umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.\
\
Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they\
entirely forgot to hail a 'bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious\
of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for\
they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any\
life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the\
plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven.\
The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had\
nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss; while Jo trudged beside\
him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how\
she ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first\
to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed\
her impetuous "Oh, yes!" were not of a coherent or reportable\
character.\
\
"Friedrich, why didn't you--"\
\
"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!"\
cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful\
delight.\
\
"I always call you so to myself--I forgot; but I won't, unless you like\
it."\
\
"Like it? it is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say 'thou,' also, and\
I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine."\
\
"Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?" asked Jo, privately thinking it a\
lovely monosyllable.\
\
"Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep\
ourselves young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou,'\
heart's dearest, it means so much to me," pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a\
romantic student than a grave professor.\
\
"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?" asked Jo\
bashfully.\
\
"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,\
because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my Jo,--ah, the\
dear, funny little name!--I had a wish to tell something the day I said\
good-by, in New York; but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to\
thee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have said 'Yes,' then, if I _had_\
spoken?"\
\
"I don't know; I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then."\
\
"Prut! that I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince came\
through the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, 'Die erste Liebe ist die\
beste;' but that I should not expect."\
\
"Yes, the first love _is_ the best; so be contented, for I never had\
another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy," said\
Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.\
\
"Good! then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all. I\
haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find, Professorin."\
\
"I like that," cried Jo, delighted with her new name. "Now tell me what\
brought you, at last, just when I most wanted you?"\
\
"This;" and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his\
waistcoat-pocket.\
\
Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own\
contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her\
sending it an occasional attempt.\
\
"How could that bring you?" she asked, wondering what he meant.\
\
"I found it by chance; I knew it by the names and the initials, and in\
it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read and find him;\
I will see that you go not in the wet."\
\
Jo obeyed, and hastily skimmed through the lines which she had\
christened--\
\
                        "IN THE GARRET.\
\
        "Four little chests all in a row,\

\
"It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I was\
very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag-bag. I never thought it would\
go where it could tell tales," said Jo, tearing up the verses the\
Professor had treasured so long.\
\
"Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read\
all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets," said Mr.\
Bhaer, with a smile, as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind.\
"Yes," he added earnestly, "I read that, and I think to myself, 'She has\
a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love. I haf a\
heart full, full for her; shall I not go and say, 'If this is not too\
poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's\
name?'"\
\
"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious\
thing I needed," whispered Jo.\
\
"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your\
welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, 'I will haf\
her if I die for it,' and so I will!" cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant\
nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he\
was to surmount or valiantly knock down.\
\
Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,\
though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.\
\
"What made you stay away so long?" she asked presently, finding it so\
pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that\
she could not keep silent.\
\
"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that\
so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to give you, after\
much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so much\
for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?"\
\
"I'm glad you _are_ poor; I couldn't bear a rich husband," said Jo\
decidedly, adding, in a softer tone, "Don't fear poverty; I've known it\
long enough to lose my dread, and be happy working for those I love; and\
don't call yourself old,--forty is the prime of life. I couldn't help\
loving you if you were seventy!"\
\
The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his\
handkerchief, if he could have got at it; as he couldn't, Jo wiped his\
eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or two,--\
\
"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now,\
for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing\
burdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.\
Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go," she added resolutely, as\
he tried to reclaim his load.\
\
"We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go away\
and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even for you,\
I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be happy\
while we hope and wait?"\
\
"Yes, I know I can; for we love one another, and that makes all the rest\
easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself\
if I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or\
impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both\
be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God\
wills."\
\
"Ah! thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif back\
but a full heart and these empty hands," cried the Professor, quite\
overcome.\
\
                   [Illustration: Under the umbrella]\
\
Jo never, never would learn to be proper; for when he said that as they\
stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering\
tenderly, "Not empty now;" and, stooping down, kissed her Friedrich\
under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the\
flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings, for\
she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her\
own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the\
crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and\
storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting\
to receive them, with a glad "Welcome home!" Jo led her lover in, and\
shut the door.\

\
\
For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met\
occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the\
price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began\
rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March\
died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over,--for they loved the\
old lady in spite of her sharp tongue,--they found they had cause for\
rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of\
joyful things possible.\
\
"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum; for of course you\
intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter\
over, some weeks later.\
\
"No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,\
whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.\
\
"You don't mean to live there?"\
\
"Yes, I do."\
\
"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of\
money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or\
three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it."\
\
"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."\
\
"And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds\
paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."\
\
"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one;" and Jo laughed.\
\
"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"\
\
"Boys. I want to open a school for little lads,--a good, happy, homelike\
school, with me to take care of them, and Fritz to teach them."\
\
"There's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her?" cried\
Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.\
\
"I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.\
\
"So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for\
trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.\
\
"It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking the head of her\
one all-absorbing son.\
\
"Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us all\
about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a\
hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.\
\
"I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,\
though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she\
speaks. Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly, "just understand\
that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long-cherished plan. Before my\
Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no one\
needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn\
little lads, who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and make\
life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin,\
for want of help at the right minute; I love so to do anything for them;\
I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and, oh,\
I should _so_ like to be a mother to them!"\
\
Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in\
her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not\
seen for a long while.\
\
"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would\
like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he's\
been doing it all his life,--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting\
rich; that he'll never be; money doesn't stay in his pocket long enough\
to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better\
than I ever deserved, _I'm_ rich, at least I feel so, and we can live at\
Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It's just the\
place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.\
There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.\
They could help in the garden and orchard: such work is healthy, isn't\
it, sir? Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way, and father will\
help him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them; and mother will\
be my stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had\
enough; now I can fill the house full, and revel in the little dears to\
my heart's content. Think what luxury,--Plumfield my own, and a\
wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!"\
\
As Jo waved her hands, and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off\
into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought\
he'd have an apoplectic fit.\
\
"I don't see anything funny," she said gravely, when she could be heard.\
"Nothing could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a\
school, and for me to prefer to reside on my own estate."\
\
"She is putting on airs already," said Laurie, who regarded the idea in\
the light of a capital joke. "But may I inquire how you intend to\
support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I'm\
afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer."\
\
"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils,\
also,--perhaps begin with such altogether; then, when I've got a start,\
I can take a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people's\
children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've seen\
unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed\
forward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagement\
or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get\
through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they need most\
patience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try\
to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn, all at once, from\
pretty children into fine young men. They don't complain much,--plucky\
little souls,--but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and\
I know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and\
like to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys'\
hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.\
I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride\
and honor to his family?"\
\
"I'll testify that you tried to do it," said Laurie, with a grateful\
look.\
\
"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes; for here you are, a steady,\
sensible business man, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying\
up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely\
a business man: you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself,\
and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I _am_\
proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and every one feels\
it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock,\
I'll just point to you, and say, 'There's your model, my lads.'"\
\
Poor Laurie didn't know where to look; for, man though he was, something\
of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all\
faces turn approvingly upon him.\
\
"I say, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his old boyish\
way. "You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,\
except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me\
off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I've\
got on at all, you may thank these two for it;" and he laid one hand\
gently on his grandfather's white head, the other on Amy's golden one,\
for the three were never far apart.\
\
"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the\
world!" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind\
just then. "When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the\
three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it\
would be quite a little heaven on earth," she added more quietly. And\
that night, when she went to her room, after a blissful evening of\
family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness\
that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near\
her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.\
\
It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen\
in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew\
where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a\
family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished\
surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich; for Mr. Laurence was\
continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the\
Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for\
its support. In this way the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and\
furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.\
\
Of course it was up-hill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes; but\
the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most\
rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her\
"wilderness of boys," and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented\
had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered\
Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of\
poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror\
of the boys for miles round; and now the exiles feasted freely on\
forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and\
played cricket in the big field where the irritable "cow with a crumpled\
horn" used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort\
of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the\
"Bhaer-garten," as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its\
inhabitants.\
\
It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a\
fortune; but it _was_ just what Jo intended it to be,--"a happy,\
homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness."\
Every room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the\
garden soon had its owner; a regular menagerie appeared in barn and\
shed, for pet animals were allowed; and, three times a day, Jo smiled at\
her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows\
of happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes,\
confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for "Mother Bhaer."\
She had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not\
angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and\
Professorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot\
which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing\
little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and, in time, success; for\
no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as\
benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times\
seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads; their\
penitent sniffs and whispers after wrong-doing; their droll or touching\
little confidences; their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even\
their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.\
There were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys;\
boys that lisped and boys that stuttered; one or two lame ones; and a\
merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was\
welcome to the "Bhaer-garten," though some people predicted that his\
admission would ruin the school.\
\
Yes; Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much\
anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily, and found the\
applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world; for\
now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers\
and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to\
increase her happiness,--Rob, named for grandpa, and Teddy, a\
happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny\
temper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up\
alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and\
aunts; but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough\
nurses loved and served them well.\
\
There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most\
delightful was the yearly apple-picking; for then the Marches,\
Laurences, Brookes, and Bhaers turned out in full force, and made a day\
of it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals\
occurred,--a mellow October day, when the air was full of an\
exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise, and the blood dance\
healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire;\
golden-rod and asters fringed the mossy walls; grasshoppers skipped\
briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a\
feast; squirrels were busy with their small harvesting; birds twittered\
their adieux from the alders in the lane; and every tree stood ready to\
send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake.\
Everybody was there; everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled\
down; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or\
such a jolly set to enjoy it; and every one gave themselves up to the\
simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things\
as care or sorrow in the world.\
\
Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella\
to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying--\
\
        "The gentle apple's winey juice."\
\
The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic\
knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook\
and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of\
ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones,\
rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among the\
birds' nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs.\
March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting\
the contributions that kept pouring in; while Amy, with a beautiful\
motherly expression in her face, sketched the various groups, and\
watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch\
beside him.\
\
Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned\
up, her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her arm,\
ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a\
charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any\
anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on\
the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent\
papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest\
anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small\
shoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and\
rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty\
welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.\
\
               [Illustration: Teddy bore a charmed life]\
\
At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the\
apple-pickers rested, and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg,\
with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass,\
for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land\
literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads\
were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment\
as they liked,--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul.\
They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for\
some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on\
their heads, others lent a charm to leap-frog by eating pie in the\
pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and\
apple-turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The\
little girls had a private tea-party, and Ted roved among the edibles at\
his own sweet will.\
\
When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular\
toast, which was always drunk at such times,--"Aunt March, God bless\
her!" A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much\
he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to\
keep her memory green.\
\
"Now, grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times\
three!"\
\
That was given with a will, as you may well believe; and the cheering\
once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed,\
from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the\
astonished guinea-pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search\
of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the\
queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were\
transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some\
of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments\
to grandma's,--for the children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch\
Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed\
was better than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi's shoe-box was a miracle\
of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut; Rob's footstool had\
a wiggle in its uneven legs, that she declared was very soothing; and no\
page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on\
which appeared, in tipsy capitals, the words,--"To dear Grandma, from\
her little Beth."\
\
During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and, when\
Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy\
wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.\
Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree\
to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sung, with all\
their hearts, the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and\
the Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was\
something altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March\
couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every\
one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little\
quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\
\
After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\
her daughters under the festival tree.\
\
[Illustration: "Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival\
                           tree."--Page 583]\
\
"I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'Unlucky Jo' again, when my\
greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified," said Mrs. Bhaer,\
taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk-pitcher, in which he was\
rapturously churning.\
\
"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\
ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?" asked Amy, smiling as she\
watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.\
\
"Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business, and\
frolic for a day," answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\
mankind. "Yes, I remember; but the life I wanted then seems selfish,\
lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope that I may write\
a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the better\
for such experiences and illustrations as these;" and Jo pointed from\
the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the\
Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one\
of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother,\
sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap\
and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which\
never could grow old to them.\
\
"My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid\
things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I\
had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I've got\
them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world;" and Meg\
laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender and\
devout content.\
\
"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter\
it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or\
confine myself to helping others fulfil their dreams of beauty. I've\
begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing\
I've ever done. I think so myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that,\
whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel."\
\
As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping\
child in her arms; for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little\
creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's sunshine.\
This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and\
sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was growing sweeter,\
deeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and\
firm; and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love\
itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blest;\
for--\
\
        "Into each life some rain must fall,\
         Some days must be dark and sad and dreary."\
\
"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, but\
hope and keep happy," said Mrs. March, as tender-hearted Daisy stooped\
from her knee, to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale\
one.\
\
"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie\
to take more than half of every burden," replied Amy warmly. "He never\
lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so devoted\
to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always, that I can't love him\
enough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, 'Thank God,\
I'm a happy woman.'"\
\
"There's no need for me to say it, for every one can see that I'm far\
happier than I deserve," added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her\
chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. "Fritz is getting\
gray and stout; I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we never\
shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that\
incorrigible Tommy Bangs _will_ smoke sweet-fern cigars under the\
bed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already. But in\
spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and\
never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys,\
I can't help using their expressions now and then."\
\
"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one," began Mrs. March,\
frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of\
countenance.\
\
"Not half so good as yours, mother. Here it is, and we never can thank\
you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done," cried Jo,\
with the loving impetuosity which she never could outgrow.\
\
"I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year," said Amy\
softly.\
\
"A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee\
dear," added Meg's tender voice.\
\
Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if\
to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and\
voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility,--\
\
"O, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater\
happiness than this!"\

                          Transcriber's Notes:\
\
\
Project Gutenberg has two versions of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.\
   Original Edition\
   Illustrated Edition\
\
Welcome to the Project Gutenberg Illustrated Edition of Little Women by\
Louisa May Alcott, published by Little, Brown, and Company. Some\
versions of the book, such as this one, use the full title of the book\
from the title page, _Little Women; Or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy_.\
\
We used the version of the book from Little, Brown, and Company:\
copyright 1896, for this transcription. A scanned copy of this book is\
available through the internet archive, courtesy of the New York Public\
Library.\
\
A copy of the first version of the novel, published in 1869, was\
consulted for emendations, the proper rendering of words hyphenated and\
split between two lines for spacing, and other issues in transcribing\
the novel. We are not trying to change this version of the novel back to\
the 1869 novel, but correct the errors that were made in re-transcribing\
and updating the text.\
\
Passages in italics were indicated by _underscores_.\
\
Passages in bold were indicated by =equal signs=.\
\
Small caps were replaced with ALL CAPS.\
\
Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of\
the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.\
\
Errors in punctuations and hyphenation were not corrected unless\
otherwise noted below.\
\
A note about spacing of illustrations: If there are four lines above the\
illustration, then the illustration was at the top of a new chapter. If\
there are four lines below the illustration, then the illustration was\
at the end of a chapter. If there is two lines between a chapter heading\
and the illustration, then the illustration was an inline illustration\
(usually a drop-cap illustration).\
\
The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up\
paragraphs and so that they are next to the text they illustrate, thus\
the page number of the illustration might not match the page number in\
the List of Illustrations.\
\
On page vii, in the Table of Contents, change page 7 to 1 for the\
beginning of Chapter One.\
\
In the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 147,\
"postmistress" was replaced with "post-mistress".\
\
In the List of Illustrations, for the illustration on page 235, \
"tea-pot" was replaced with "teapot".\
\
On page 30, the punctuation after 'stained they are' may be a colon, but\
on page 41 of the 1869 book, it is a semicolon. We used the semi-colon. \
\
On page 34, transcribe red-headed with the hyphen. See page 44 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 40, a period was added after "room where old Mr". See page 50 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 41, the semicolon after "Laurie went on the box" was replaced\
with a comma. See page 52 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 62, mantel-piece was transcribed with the hyphen. See Page 75 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 63, checked the clause "and I've been trying to do it this ever\
so long." It is written the same way on page 77 of the 1869 book. No\
change was made.\
\
On page 64, add period after "red and shining with merriment." See page\
79 of the 1869 book.\
\
On page 68, changed weet to sweet in 'the damp weet air.' See page 84 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 79, add comma after I remain in the letter. See page 95 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 84, ferrule was an adjustment from the 1869 book, which only\
used one r in spelling the word (see page 101). Webster's dictionary\
spells ferrule with two rs.\
\
On page 109, a period was added after "and the old man quite dotes on\
them". See page 130 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 109, a period was added after "asked another voice". See page\
131 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 112, change colon to semicolon after "if you don't;"--see page\
134 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 113, transcribe ear-rings with the hyphen. See page 135 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On Page 123, "One thing remember, my girls:" is written as it appears in\
the 1896 novel. A comma instead of a colon was used after my girls in\
the 1869 novel (see page 146). "One thing =to= remember," may work\
better today, or even "Remember one thing," but we left this as Ms.\
Alcott wrote it.\
\
On Page 124, the P. C. is the Pickwick Club from a novel by Charles\
Dickens. Samuel Pickwick, Tracy Tupman, Augustus Snodgrass, and\
Nathaniel Winkle were introdued by Charles Dickens in the first chapter\
of The Pickwick Papers. Samuel Weller makes his first appearance in\
Chapter Ten of that novel.\
\
On page 128, in the Pickwick Portfolio, there is no period after "it is\
nearly school time" in N.\'a0Winkle's letter. This period was also missing\
on page 151 of the 1869 novel. The missing period was intentional.\
\
On page 135, the ambiguous punctuation after "Oh, dear, no!" is an\
exclamation point. See page 160 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 146, change buttonholes to button-holes. On page 173 of the 1869\
novel, this word was hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing.\
There were seven other occurrences of button-hole or button-holes in the\
novel.  We therefore used the hyphen.\
\
On page 150, "Betty" was replaced with "Bethy". This error was also made\
in the 1869 novel--see page 177. The character addressed is Beth. \
\
On page 158, a period was added after "still kneeling". See page 187 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 160, "hard a lee" is spelled the same way in the 1869 novel (see\
page 189) and this novel. We left this as is.\
\
On page 166, a comma was added after "Meg" in "Meg obediently\
following". See page 195 of the 1869 book.\
\
On page 185, "receptable" was replaced with "receptacle". See page 217\
of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 185, transcribe door-way with the hyphen. See page 217 of the\
1869 novel. Also, change doorway to door-way a few lines down the same\
page. See page 218 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 189, the comma after "published every day" was replaced with a\
period. See page 225 of 1869 book.\
\
On page 198, the clause: "Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of\
bottles of old wine:" was written as it appeared in the 1896 novel. The\
clause ended in with a semi-colon in the 1869 book (see page 234). \
\
On page 200, change needlework to needle-work. See page 236 of the 1869\
novel.\
\
On page 209, "turnovers" was replaced with "turn-overs". See page 246 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 214, the single quotation mark before "Head Nurse of Ward" was\
replaced with a double quotation mark. See page 252 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 218, "Year's ago" was replaced with "Years ago". See page 257 of\
the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 219, "ask him so help" was replaced with "ask him to help". See\
page 257 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 219, add period after "give it to her." See page 258 of the 1869\
novel. \
\
On page 230, "two, A.M." is spelled the same way, with the comma, in\
this book and in the 1869 novel (on page 272). The comma was retained.\
\
On page 244, "postscrips" was replaced with "postscripts". See page 287\
of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 279, place exclamation point after won't in 'No, I won't!' See\
page 329 in the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 286, "actingly" was replaced with "acting". See page 337 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 288, add comma after mankind in the clause "who felt at peace\
with all mankind even his mischievous pupil." See page 339 of the 1869\
novel.\
\
On page 294, transcribe gray-headed with the hyphen. See page 5 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 295, add a comma after salary in the phrase "with an\
honestly-earned salary." See page 7 of the 1869 book.\
\
Checked the clause "But once get used to these slight blemishes" on page\
297. The sentence appears the same way on page 10 of the 1869 novel. \
\
Checked the clause "People who hire all these things done for them never\
know what they lose" on page 298. The sentence has a comma after them,\
but is otherwise written the same way on page 11 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 299, transcribe door-handles with the hyphen. See page 13 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 339, "shortcomings" was replaced with "short-comings". See page\
62 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 345, "furbelows and notions" was written "furbelows and\
quinny-dingles" in the 1869 novel. See page 59 of the 1869 novel. We\
made no change, and only point this out because quinny-dingles is such a\
memorable word that those intimate with the novel may notice the change.\
\
On page 353, change snowbank to snow-bank. See page 79 of the 1869\
novel.\
\
On page 363, a double quotation mark was added before "Cross-patch, draw\
the latch". See page 91 of the 1869 book.\
\
On page 379, change period after Jo to a comma in the clause "as for Jo.\
she would have gone up". See page 109 of the 1869 book.\
\
On page 380, a comma was added after "all lying down". See page 111 of\
the 1869 book.\
\
On page 393, the punctuation after 'but so was everybody's' is difficult\
to read. It could be a colon or semicolon. In the 1869 novel, the mark\
is a semi-colon (see page 126). We used the semi-colon.\
\
On page 396, the second line of the verse beginning with "'Out upon\
you," is indented. In the 1869 version, the capital B of "Bold-faced\
jig!'" is lined-up under Out. We aligned the verse as the 1869 version\
of the novel--see page 131.\
\
On page 404, add period after heaviness. See page 140 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 405, transcribe needle-work with the hyphen. See page 141 of the\
1869 book.\
\
On Page 411, a letter is curiously addressed to Betsey, both here and on\
page 148 of the 1869 book. \
\
On Page 413, removed double quotes around Yes in "Yes," they say to one\
another, these so kind ladies. Instead, place a single quote in front of\
Yes, because Bhaer is resuming his quote. The resumed quote concludes\
with a single quote after me and mine. See page 151 of the 1869 novel.\
The double quote before 'he is a stupid old fellow' is actually a\
triple-nested quote, ending in make themselves.\
\
On page 417, transcribe Teddy-ism as Teddyism. See page 155 of the 1869\
novel.\
\
On page 451, a period was added after "I can't let you go". See page 196\
of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 463, "Tarantula" was used as the name of a dance, but the author\
might have meant "Tarantella," which is the name of an Italian dance\
about tarantulas.\
\
On page 468, transcribe chess-board with the hyphen. See page 218 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On page 512, a period was added after "she said softly". If you see page\
272 of the 1869 novel, you will also notice a comma in 'she said,\
softly.' We added the period but not the comma.\
\
On page 514, the 1869 novel did not have a comma after oar in the\
sentence: "I'm not tired; but you may take an oar, if you like. See page\
525 of the 1869 novel. We did not remove the comma.\
\
On page 527, "the 'the best nevvy" was replaced with "the best nevvy".\
\
On page 527, change he to the in 'like Jenny and he ballad'. See page\
291 of the 1869 novel.\
\
On page 531, David and Peggotty refer to two characters from the novel\
"David Copperfield" by Charles Dickens.\
\
On page 534, change of to off in the clause: Daisy found it impossible\
to keep her eyes of her "pitty aunty," ... see page 300 of the 1869\
novel.\
\
On page 541, "know'st thou the land where the citron blooms," was broken\
into two stanzas in the book for spacing. We transcribed this as one\
line. See page 308 in 1869 novel.\
\
On page 551, transcribe Dove-cote with the hyphen. See page 319 of the\
1869 novel.\
\
On the first page of ads, a period was added after "THE LITTLE WOMEN\
SERIES. New Illustrated Edition".\
\
On the second page of ads, in the blurb for the book Comic Tragedies, a\
period as placed after "Portraits, etc".\
\
After the novel is a list of The Works of Louisa May Alcott. The list is\
not complete: for example, there are no listings for her work as Flora\
Fairfield or A.\'a0M. Barnard. Nevertheless, the pages are a fine\
structured outline of Ms. Alcott's best work.\
\
Most of the novels and stories in these four pages are published by\
Project Gutenberg. We included links to these titles for the reader's\
convenience. A change had to be made for one item: We had to list each\
of the three volumes of Lulu's Library to provide the links to that\
book. These links will only work in the HTML document.\
\
The final page is a listing of eleven stories originally published in\
other volumes, such as Jo's Scrap-Bag, Lulu's Library, and A Garland for\
Girls. These works were subsequently published separately in small\
volumes, generally less than 100 pages, in The Children's Friend Series. \

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\
will be renamed.\
\
Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no\
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,\
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to\
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works to\
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG\'99 concept and trademark.  Project\
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you\
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you\
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the\
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose\
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and\
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do\
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is\
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial\
redistribution.\

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\
all copies of Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works in your possession.\
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\
\
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be\
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works\
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\

Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works\
in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you\
from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating\
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project\
Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the\
Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic\
works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg\'99 works in compliance with\
the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg\'99 name\
associated with the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this\
agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full\
Project Gutenberg\'99 License when you share it without charge with\
others.\
\
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\
States.\

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\

1.F.\
\
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg\'99 collection.\
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works, and the\
medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but\
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription\
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a\
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer\
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\
\
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\
Gutenberg\'99 trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\
Gutenberg\'99 electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\
opportunities to fix the problem.\

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\
\
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\
providing copies of Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works in accordance\

promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic works,\
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\
Project Gutenberg\'99 work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\
\
\
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\'99\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\'99 and future generations.\
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\

\
Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit http://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\

\
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg\'99 electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\'99\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg\'99 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
Project Gutenberg\'99 eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\
\
     http://www.gutenberg.org\
\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
