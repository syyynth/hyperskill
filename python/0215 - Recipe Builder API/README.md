This is the *Recipe Builder API* project I made myself.


<div><p>Tired of fast food and deliveries? Sometimes, the urge to have something fancy is just too hard to beat! Let's turn to a recipe book. There's a lot of recipes in the book, and all of them are so appetizing. The search for the best recipe can take quite a while. Let's automate this to save time and a great deal of effort. Create a web service with Flask that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes. By creating this app, you will be able to fetch recipes in seconds. All you have to do is to choose the best recipe from the pre-uploaded list of possible recipes.</p>

<p>The team of creators of this project is aware that the project now may contain some inaccuracies and possibly bugs, so we do not recommend to choose this project to those who are not ready for that, but we will be very happy if you choose it and help us with its improvement with your comments, reports and feedback!</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/215?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/215</a>
