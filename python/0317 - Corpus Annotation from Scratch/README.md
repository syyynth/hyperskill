Any serious NLP experiment requires data processing. In most cases, you use ready-made data, but sometimes you need to compile a corpus yourself. Depending on the task, you may also need certain information about your text: part-of-speech tags, named entities, statistical characteristics, and so on. In this project, you will learn how to convert raw text into a corpus for further research.
