Any serious NLP experiment requires data processing. In most cases, you use ready-made data, but sometimes you need to compile a corpus yourself. Depending on the task, you may also need certain information about your text: part-of-speech tags, named entities, statistical characteristics, and so on. In this project, you will learn how to convert raw text into a corpus for further research.

Example:
```text
> test/clockwork_orange.txt
Number of multi-word named entities: 720
Number of lemmas 'devotchka': 12
Number of tokens with the stem 'milk': 5
Most frequent entity type: LOC
Most frequent named entity token: ('English', 'LANGUAGE')
Most common non-English words: {'prestoopnick': 11, 'govoreeting': 10, 'tolchocking': 5, 'crystallography': 4, 'malchickiwick': 3}
Correlation between NOUN and PROPN and named entities: 0.44
