This is the *Text Generator* project I made myself.


<p>Machine learning is getting crazy smart these days. You've probably read texts or scripts written by machine learning algorithms, some of them even mimicking styles of certain people! If you ever wondered how it works and what are the secrets behind machine learning, this project is for you! You will have a chance to understand and implement a simple text generator using Markov chains.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/134?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/134</a>

Thoros she's keeping me as your bannermen.
Killed those boys. They won.
The girls are idiots. You remind me of lying?
You treated them with dragonglass.
â€œSo give me a castle spitting down on a beach made of Valyrian stone.
Not an army A horde Dothraki?
PETER BAELISH and a keep of his bannermen.
Everyone else was on her own sister?
This one has the will, he has not offended Your Grace, if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill him?
It's our war. Go on, girls.
