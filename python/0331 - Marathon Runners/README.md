This is the *Marathon Runners* project I made myself.


<p>Do you want to discover a little more about machine learning?Â Let's implement one of the most popular algorithms! In this project, you're going to use basic python tools to code the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) that solves classification problems.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/331?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/331</a>

_Example:_
Data is placed in:
train = Data/data_about_marathon_runners.txt
test = Data/test.txt

```python
Result with k = 1: [1, 0, 0]
Result with k = 3: [1, 0, 1]
Result with k = 5: [1, 0, 1]
```
