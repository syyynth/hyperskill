This project doesn't have any code (text based answers), it's just an indication of accomplishment.

This is the *Naive Bayes Classifier with Pen and Paper* project.

<p>Language identification is a task of Natural Language Processing. It consists in determining which language your data belongs to. Essentially, it is a classification problem where you have to assign language labels to sentences or texts. Could you ever imagine that all you need for a language identification system is a pen and a piece of paper? Yes, you got it right: no programming skills, no linguistic expertise. Letâ€™s try it out! We will use the Naive Bayes approach to create a simple classifier and solve this problem.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/321?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/321</a>
