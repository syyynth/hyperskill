The modern world is rapid and dynamic, and every day people read a lot of news about politics, science, entertainment industry, programming, and so on. When there is so much information to digest, it gets really hard to deal with all of it! In this project, you will get familiar with something that might help: simple text summarization technique. This method extracts the most important sentences from the given text and is a great baseline for further experiments with other summarization approaches.
