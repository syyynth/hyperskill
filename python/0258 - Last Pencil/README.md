This is the *Last Pencil (Python)* project I made myself.


<p>Playing with friends is pure fun but getting ahead of them is even more enjoyable.

But it's up to you to choose who wins.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/258?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/258</a>
