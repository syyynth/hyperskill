This is the *Generating Randomness* project I made myself.


<p>Everyone knows that people are bad at generating random things. In this project, we will check this assumption using a small self-written program that will predict "random" user actions. We'll see if you can beat it!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/156?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/156</a>

```python
Please provide AI some data to learn...
The current data length is 0, 100 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 010100100101010101000010001010101010100100100101001
The current data length is 51, 49 symbols left
Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 011010001011111100101010100011001010101010010001001010010011

Final data string:
010100100101010101000010001010101010100100100101001011010001011111100101010100011001010101010010001001010010011

You have $1000. Every time the system successfully predicts your next press, you lose $1.
Otherwise, you earn $1. Print "enough" to leave the game. Let's go!

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:

> 0111001001
predictions:
0101011

Computer guessed 4 out of 7 symbols right (57.14 %)
Your balance is now $999

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
