This is the *Linear Regression from Scratch* project I made myself.


<p>Linear relationship estimation is probably the first kind of modeling we come across at school. Linear regression is one of the most popular methods for estimating linear relationships and one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. This project explains how the linear regression algorithm works. These basics will help you with model interpretation and debugging if you want to fit and predict linear models.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/195?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/195</a>
